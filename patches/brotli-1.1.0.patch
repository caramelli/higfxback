+                ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND
+
+                          Lewis Carroll
+
+               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 2.9
+
+
+
+
+                            CHAPTER I
+
+                      Down the Rabbit-Hole
+
+
+  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
+on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had
+peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
+pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'
+thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'
+
+  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
+for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
+the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
+of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
+Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
+
+  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice
+think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
+itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought
+it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
+wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
+but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
+POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
+her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
+before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
+take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
+field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
+down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
+
+  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
+considering how in the world she was to get out again.
+
+  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
+and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
+moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
+falling down a very deep well.
+
+  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she
+had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
+wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look
+down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to
+see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
+noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
+here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She
+took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was
+labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it
+was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
+somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
+fell past it.
+
+  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I
+shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll
+all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,
+even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely
+true.)
+
+  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I
+wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.
+`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let
+me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,
+you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
+lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good
+opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to
+listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,
+that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
+or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,
+or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
+say.)
+
+  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right
+THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the
+people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I
+think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this
+time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall
+have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
+Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried
+to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
+through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what
+an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll
+never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
+
+  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
+began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I
+should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember
+her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were
+down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but
+you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.
+But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get
+rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
+way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do
+bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either
+question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt
+that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she
+was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very
+earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a
+bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of
+sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
+
+  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
+moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her
+was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
+sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:
+away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it
+say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late
+it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the
+corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found
+herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
+hanging from the roof.
+
+  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
+and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
+other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
+wondering how she was ever to get out again.
+
+  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of
+solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
+and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the
+doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or
+the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of
+them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
+curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little
+door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key
+in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
+
+  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
+passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and
+looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
+How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
+among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
+she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if
+my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of
+very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish
+I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only
+know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things
+had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
+things indeed were really impossible.
+
+  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she
+went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on
+it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
+telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which
+certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck
+of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'
+beautifully printed on it in large letters.
+
+  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little
+Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look
+first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';
+for she had read several nice little histories about children who
+had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
+things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules
+their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker
+will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
+finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had
+never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
+`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or
+later.
+
+  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured
+to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort
+of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
+turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished
+it off.
+
+     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
+
+         *       *       *       *       *       *
+
+     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
+
+  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up
+like a telescope.'
+
+  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and
+her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right
+size for going though the little door into that lovely garden.
+First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was
+going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about
+this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my
+going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be
+like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is
+like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
+ever having seen such a thing.
+
+  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided
+on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when
+she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden
+key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she
+could not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainly
+through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the
+legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had
+tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and
+cried.
+
+  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to
+herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'
+She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very
+seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so
+severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered
+trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
+of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious
+child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no
+use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,
+there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
+person!'
+
+  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
+the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on
+which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.
+`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,
+I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
+under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I
+don't care which happens!'
+
+  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which
+way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to
+feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to
+find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally
+happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the
+way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,
+that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
+common way.
+
+  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
+
+     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
+
+         *       *       *       *       *       *
+
+     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
+
+
+
+
+                           CHAPTER II
+
+                        The Pool of Tears
+
+
+  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much
+surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
+English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that
+ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her
+feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so
+far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on
+your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't
+be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
+about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be
+kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the
+way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of
+boots every Christmas.'
+
+  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
+`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll
+seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the
+directions will look!
+
+            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
+                HEARTHRUG,
+                    NEAR THE FENDER,
+                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).
+
+Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
+
+  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in
+fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took
+up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
+
+  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one
+side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get
+through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to
+cry again.
+
+  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great
+girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in
+this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all
+the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool
+all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the
+hall.
+
+  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the
+distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
+It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a
+pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
+other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
+himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she
+be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate
+that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
+came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,
+sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid
+gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard
+as he could go.
+
+  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very
+hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:
+`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday
+things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in
+the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this
+morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little
+different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in
+the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began
+thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
+as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of
+them.
+
+  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such
+long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm
+sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,
+oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,
+and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the
+things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,
+and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!
+I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the
+Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.
+London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,
+and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been
+changed for Mabel!  I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'
+and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,
+and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and
+strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--
+
+            `How doth the little crocodile
+              Improve his shining tail,
+            And pour the waters of the Nile
+              On every golden scale!
+
+            `How cheerfully he seems to grin,
+              How neatly spread his claws,
+            And welcome little fishes in
+              With gently smiling jaws!'
+
+  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and
+her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel
+after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
+house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so
+many lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm
+Mabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their
+heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"  I shall only look
+up and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I
+like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down
+here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a
+sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads
+down!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'
+
+  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was
+surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little
+white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done
+that?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up
+and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,
+as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,
+and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the
+cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it
+hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
+
+`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at
+the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
+existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed
+back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut
+again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
+before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,
+`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare
+it's too bad, that it is!'
+
+  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another
+moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He first
+idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that
+case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had
+been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general
+conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find
+a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in
+the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and
+behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that
+she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
+feet high.
+
+  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,
+trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I
+suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer
+thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'
+
+  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a
+little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at
+first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then
+she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that
+it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
+
+  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this
+mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should
+think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in
+trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of
+this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'
+(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:
+she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having
+seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a
+mouse--a mouse--O mouse!'  The Mouse looked at her rather
+inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
+eyes, but it said nothing.
+
+  `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I
+daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the
+Conqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had
+no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she
+began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in
+her French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the
+water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg
+your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the
+poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'
+
+  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate
+voice.  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'
+
+  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be
+angry about it.  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:
+I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
+She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,
+as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so
+nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and
+she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital
+one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,
+for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt
+certain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any
+more if you'd rather not.'
+
+  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end
+of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family
+always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear
+the name again!'
+
+  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the
+subject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'
+The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is
+such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!
+A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly
+brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and
+it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I
+can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you
+know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!
+He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a
+sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the
+Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and
+making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
+
+  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back
+again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't
+like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam
+slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice
+thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to
+the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll
+understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
+
+  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded
+with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a
+Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious
+creatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the
+shore.
+
+
+
+                           CHAPTER III
+
+                  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
+
+
+  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the
+bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their
+fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and
+uncomfortable.
+
+  The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they
+had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed
+quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with
+them, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had
+quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,
+and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';
+and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,
+and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no
+more to be said.
+
+  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among
+them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL
+soon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a large
+ring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice kept her eyes
+anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad
+cold if she did not get dry very soon.
+
+  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?
+This is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round, if you please!
+"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was
+soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been
+of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and
+Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'
+
+  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
+
+  `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very
+politely:  `Did you speak?'
+
+  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
+
+  `I thought you did,' said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  "Edwin and
+Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:
+and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found
+it advisable--"'
+
+  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.
+
+  `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you
+know what "it" means.'
+
+  `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said
+the Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,
+what did the archbishop find?'
+
+  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,
+`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William
+and offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first was
+moderate.  But the insolence of his Normans--"  How are you
+getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it
+spoke.
+
+  `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't
+seem to dry me at all.'
+
+  `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I
+move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
+energetic remedies--'
+
+  `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning of
+half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do
+either!'  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:
+some of the other birds tittered audibly.
+
+  `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,
+`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
+
+  `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much
+to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
+ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
+
+  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'
+(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter
+day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
+
+  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the
+exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party
+were placed along the course, here and there.  There was no `One,
+two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,
+and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know
+when the race was over.  However, when they had been running half
+an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called
+out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,
+and asking, `But who has won?'
+
+  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
+thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
+its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
+in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.  At
+last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have
+prizes.'
+
+  `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices
+asked.
+
+  `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with
+one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,
+calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'
+
+  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand
+in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt
+water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
+There was exactly one a-piece all round.
+
+  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.
+
+  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have
+you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
+
+  `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
+
+  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
+
+  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
+solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of
+this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short
+speech, they all cheered.
+
+  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked
+so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not
+think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,
+looking as solemn as she could.
+
+  The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise
+and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not
+taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
+the back.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again
+in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
+
+  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,
+`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half
+afraid that it would be offended again.
+
+  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to
+Alice, and sighing.
+
+  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with
+wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?'  And
+she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so
+that her idea of the tale was something like this:--
+
+                    `Fury said to a
+                   mouse, That he
+                 met in the
+               house,
+            "Let us
+              both go to
+                law:  I will
+                  prosecute
+                    YOU.  --Come,
+                       I'll take no
+                        denial; We
+                     must have a
+                 trial:  For
+              really this
+           morning I've
+          nothing
+         to do."
+           Said the
+             mouse to the
+               cur, "Such
+                 a trial,
+                   dear Sir,
+                         With
+                     no jury
+                  or judge,
+                would be
+              wasting
+             our
+              breath."
+               "I'll be
+                 judge, I'll
+                   be jury,"
+                         Said
+                    cunning
+                      old Fury:
+                     "I'll
+                      try the
+                         whole
+                          cause,
+                             and
+                        condemn
+                       you
+                      to
+                       death."'
+
+
+  `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.
+`What are you thinking of?'
+
+  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to
+the fifth bend, I think?'
+
+  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
+
+  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and
+looking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'
+
+  `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up
+and walking away.  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'
+
+  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.  `But you're so easily
+offended, you know!'
+
+  The Mouse only growled in reply.
+
+  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after
+it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but
+the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
+quicker.
+
+  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it
+was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of
+saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you
+never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the
+young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the
+patience of an oyster!'
+
+  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,
+addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'
+
+  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'
+said the Lory.
+
+  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about
+her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for
+catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her
+after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look
+at it!'
+
+  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
+Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began
+wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be
+getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary
+called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my
+dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts
+they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
+
+  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a
+melancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm
+sure she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I
+wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice
+began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.
+In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of
+footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping
+that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to
+finish his story.
+
+
+
+                           CHAPTER IV
+
+                The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
+
+
+  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and
+looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;
+and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!
+Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me
+executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have
+dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was
+looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she
+very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
+nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her
+swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and
+the little door, had vanished completely.
+
+  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,
+and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE
+you doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of
+gloves and a fan!  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened
+that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without
+trying to explain the mistake it had made.
+
+  `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.
+`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!  But I'd
+better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'
+As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door
+of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'
+engraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried
+upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,
+and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
+gloves.
+
+  `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going
+messages for a rabbit!  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on
+messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that
+would happen:  `"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready
+for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see
+that the mouse doesn't get out."  Only I don't think,' Alice went
+on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
+people about like that!'
+
+  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with
+a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two
+or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and
+a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when
+her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-
+glass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'
+but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know
+SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,
+`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this
+bottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for
+really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
+
+  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:
+before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing
+against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being
+broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself
+`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I
+can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so
+much!'
+
+  Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and
+growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in
+another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried
+the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the
+other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,
+as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one
+foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,
+whatever happens.  What WILL become of me?'
+
+  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full
+effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,
+and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
+out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
+
+  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one
+wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about
+by mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone down that
+rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,
+this sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
+When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing
+never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!  There
+ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!  And when
+I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a
+sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more
+HERE.'
+
+  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I
+am now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-
+-but then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like
+THAT!'
+
+  `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.  `How can you
+learn lessons in here?  Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no
+room at all for any lesson-books!'
+
+  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,
+and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few
+minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
+
+  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves
+this moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the
+stairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and
+she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she
+was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no
+reason to be afraid of it.
+
+  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;
+but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed
+hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it
+say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'
+
+  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she
+fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly
+spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not
+get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,
+and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was
+just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
+of the sort.
+
+  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are
+you?'  And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then
+I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'
+
+  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!
+Come and help me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.)
+
+  `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'
+
+  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.')
+
+  `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why, it
+fills the whole window!'
+
+  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.'
+
+  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it
+away!'
+
+  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear
+whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer
+honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at
+last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in
+the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more
+sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there
+must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for
+pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I
+don't want to stay in here any longer!'
+
+  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at
+last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a
+good many voice all talking together:  she made out the words:
+`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;
+Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up
+at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half
+high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-
+-Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind
+that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!  Heads below!' (a loud
+crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go
+down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,
+then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
+go down the chimney!'
+
+  `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said
+Alice to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
+I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is
+narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'
+
+  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and
+waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what
+sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
+above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one
+sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.
+
+  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes
+Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the
+hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold
+up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?
+What happened to you?  Tell us all about it!'
+
+  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'
+thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm
+better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know
+is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes
+like a sky-rocket!'
+
+  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.
+
+  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and
+Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.  I'll set
+Dinah at you!'
+
+  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to
+herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any
+sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they
+began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A
+barrowful will do, to begin with.'
+
+  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to
+doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
+rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.
+`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,
+`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead
+silence.
+
+  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
+turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright
+idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she
+thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it
+can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I
+suppose.'
+
+  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find
+that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small
+enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and
+found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.
+The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by
+two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.
+They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she
+ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a
+thick wood.
+
+  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she
+wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;
+and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
+I think that will be the best plan.'
+
+  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and
+simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the
+smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering
+about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over
+her head made her look up in a great hurry.
+
+  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
+eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
+`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried
+hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the
+time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it
+would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
+
+  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of
+stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped
+into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,
+and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice
+dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run
+over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy
+made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in
+its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very
+like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
+moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle
+again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
+stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long
+way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat
+down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its
+mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
+
+  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;
+so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out
+of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the
+distance.
+
+  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she
+leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself
+with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks
+very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh
+dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let
+me see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
+drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'
+
+  The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round
+her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see
+anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
+the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,
+about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under
+it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her
+that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
+
+  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of
+the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large
+caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,
+quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice
+of her or of anything else.
+
+
+
+                            CHAPTER V
+
+                    Advice from a Caterpillar
+
+
+  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
+silence:  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
+mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
+
+  `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  Alice
+replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--
+at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think
+I must have been changed several times since then.'
+
+  `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.
+`Explain yourself!'
+
+  `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because
+I'm not myself, you see.'
+
+  `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very
+politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and
+being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'
+
+  `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but
+when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you
+know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll
+feel it a little queer, won't you?'
+
+  `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;
+`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'
+
+  `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'
+
+  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
+conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's
+making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,
+very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'
+
+  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not
+think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
+a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
+
+  `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something
+important to say!'
+
+  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back
+again.
+
+  `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as
+she could.
+
+  `No,' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else
+to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
+hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but
+at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth
+again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'
+
+  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as
+I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
+
+  `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it
+all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
+
+  `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  Alice folded her hands, and began:--
+
+    `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,
+      `And your hair has become very white;
+    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
+      Do you think, at your age, it is right?'
+
+    `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,
+      `I feared it might injure the brain;
+    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
+      Why, I do it again and again.'
+
+    `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,
+      And have grown most uncommonly fat;
+    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
+      Pray, what is the reason of that?'
+
+    `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
+      `I kept all my limbs very supple
+    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
+      Allow me to sell you a couple?'
+
+    `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak
+      For anything tougher than suet;
+    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
+      Pray how did you manage to do it?'
+
+    `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,
+      And argued each case with my wife;
+    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
+      Has lasted the rest of my life.'
+
+    `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose
+      That your eye was as steady as ever;
+    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
+      What made you so awfully clever?'
+
+    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'
+      Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!
+    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
+      Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'
+
+
+  `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the
+words have got altered.'
+
+  `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar
+decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.
+
+  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
+
+  `What size do you want to be?' it asked.
+
+  `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;
+`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
+
+  `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in
+her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
+
+  `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
+
+  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you
+wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched
+height to be.'
+
+  `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar
+angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three
+inches high).
+
+  `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
+And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so
+easily offended!'
+
+  `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it
+put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
+
+  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.
+In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
+mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got
+down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely
+remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and
+the other side will make you grow shorter.'
+
+  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to
+herself.
+
+  `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had
+asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
+
+  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a
+minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as
+it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.
+However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
+would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
+
+  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a
+little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment
+she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her
+foot!
+
+  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but
+she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking
+rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
+Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was
+hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and
+managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.
+
+
+     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
+
+         *       *       *       *       *       *
+
+     *       *       *       *       *       *       *
+
+  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of
+delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she
+found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could
+see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which
+seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
+far below her.
+
+  `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.  `And where
+HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I
+can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no
+result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the
+distant green leaves.
+
+  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her
+head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted
+to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,
+like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a
+graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which
+she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
+had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
+hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating
+her violently with its wings.
+
+  `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
+
+  `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'
+
+  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more
+subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every
+way, and nothing seems to suit them!'
+
+  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said
+Alice.
+
+  `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've
+tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but
+those serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'
+
+  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no
+use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
+
+  `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the
+Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and
+day!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'
+
+  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was
+beginning to see its meaning.
+
+  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued
+the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was
+thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come
+wriggling down from the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'
+
+  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.  `I'm a--I'm
+a--'
+
+  `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can see you're
+trying to invent something!'
+
+  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she
+remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.
+
+  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the
+deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my
+time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a
+serpent; and there's no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be
+telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'
+
+  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very
+truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
+serpents do, you know.'
+
+  `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why
+then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
+
+  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent
+for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of
+adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and
+what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a
+serpent?'
+
+  `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm
+not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't
+want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'
+
+  `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it
+settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the
+trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled
+among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and
+untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the
+pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very
+carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and
+growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
+succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
+
+  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,
+that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a
+few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,
+there's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes
+are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to
+another!  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next
+thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be
+done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an
+open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
+`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come
+upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their
+wits!'  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did
+not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself
+down to nine inches high.
+
+
+
+                           CHAPTER VI
+
+                         Pig and Pepper
+
+
+  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and
+wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
+running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman
+because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only,
+she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door
+with his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,
+with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,
+Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their
+heads.  She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and
+crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
+
+  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great
+letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to
+the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.  An
+invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman
+repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the
+words a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess
+to play croquet.'
+
+  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled
+together.
+
+  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into
+the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped
+out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the
+ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
+
+  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
+
+  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and
+that for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the
+door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise
+inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was
+a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling
+and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish
+or kettle had been broken to pieces.
+
+  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'
+
+  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went
+on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For
+instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let
+you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time
+he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But
+perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so
+VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might
+answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.
+
+  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'
+
+  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate
+came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just
+grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees
+behind him.
+
+  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,
+exactly as if nothing had happened.
+
+  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
+
+  `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's the
+first question, you know.'
+
+  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.
+`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the
+creatures argue.  It's enough to drive one crazy!'
+
+  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
+repeating his remark, with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he
+said, `on and off, for days and days.'
+
+  `But what am I to do?' said Alice.
+
+  `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.
+
+  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:
+`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.
+
+  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of
+smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a
+three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was
+leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to
+be full of soup.
+
+  `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to
+herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
+
+  There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the
+Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was
+sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The
+only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,
+and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from
+ear to ear.
+
+  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for
+she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to
+speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'
+
+  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.
+Pig!'
+
+  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
+quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
+to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on
+again:--
+
+  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I
+didn't know that cats COULD grin.'
+
+  `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'
+
+  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,
+feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.
+
+  `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'
+
+  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought
+it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
+conversation.  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took
+the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work
+throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby
+--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,
+plates, and dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when
+they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it
+was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
+
+  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up
+and down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS
+nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very
+nearly carried it off.
+
+  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a
+hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it
+does.'
+
+  `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very
+glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her
+knowledge.  `Just think of what work it would make with the day
+and night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn
+round on its axis--'
+
+  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'
+
+  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant
+to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and
+seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four
+hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?  I--'
+
+  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide
+figures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again,
+singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a
+violent shake at the end of every line:
+
+        `Speak roughly to your little boy,
+          And beat him when he sneezes:
+        He only does it to annoy,
+          Because he knows it teases.'
+
+                    CHORUS.
+
+    (In which the cook and the baby joined):--
+
+                `Wow! wow! wow!'
+
+  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept
+tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing
+howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--
+
+        `I speak severely to my boy,
+          I beat him when he sneezes;
+        For he can thoroughly enjoy
+          The pepper when he pleases!'
+
+                    CHORUS.
+
+                `Wow! wow! wow!'
+
+  `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said
+to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.  `I must go and
+get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of
+the room.  The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,
+but it just missed her.
+
+  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-
+shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all
+directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.  The poor
+little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,
+and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,
+so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much
+as she could do to hold it.
+
+  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,
+(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep
+tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its
+undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.  `IF I
+don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure
+to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it
+behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing
+grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't
+grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing
+yourself.'
+
+  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into
+its face to see what was the matter with it.  There could be no
+doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout
+than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for
+a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at
+all.  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked
+into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.
+
+  No, there were no tears.  `If you're going to turn into a pig,
+my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do
+with you.  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed again (or
+grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for
+some while in silence.
+
+  Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I
+to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted
+again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some
+alarm.  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was
+neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be
+quite absurd for her to carry it further.
+
+  So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to
+see it trot away quietly into the wood.  `If it had grown up,'
+she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:
+but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And she began
+thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as
+pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right
+way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing
+the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
+
+  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.  It looked good-
+natured, she thought:  still it had VERY long claws and a great
+many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
+
+  `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at
+all know whether it would like the name:  however, it only
+grinned a little wider.  `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought
+Alice, and she went on.  `Would you tell me, please, which way I
+ought to go from here?'
+
+  `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said
+the Cat.
+
+  `I don't much care where--' said Alice.
+
+  `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.
+
+  `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.
+
+  `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk
+long enough.'
+
+  Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
+question.  `What sort of people live about here?'
+
+  `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,
+`lives a Hatter:  and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,
+`lives a March Hare.  Visit either you like:  they're both mad.'
+
+  `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.
+
+  `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're all mad here.
+I'm mad.  You're mad.'
+
+  `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.
+
+  `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'
+
+  Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on
+`And how do you know that you're mad?'
+
+  `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad.  You grant
+that?'
+
+  `I suppose so,' said Alice.
+
+  `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's
+angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm
+pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.'
+
+  `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.
+
+  `Call it what you like,' said the Cat.  `Do you play croquet
+with the Queen to-day?'
+
+  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been
+invited yet.'
+
+  `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
+
+  Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used
+to queer things happening.  While she was looking at the place
+where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.
+
+  `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat.  `I'd
+nearly forgotten to ask.'
+
+  `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had
+come back in a natural way.
+
+  `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.
+
+  Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it
+did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the
+direction in which the March Hare was said to live.  `I've seen
+hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be
+much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be
+raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'  As she said
+this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a
+branch of a tree.
+
+  `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.
+
+  `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep
+appearing and vanishing so suddenly:  you make one quite giddy.'
+
+  `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite
+slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the
+grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
+
+  `Well!  I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;
+`but a grin without a cat!  It's the most curious thing I ever
+say in my life!'
+
+  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the
+house of the March Hare:  she thought it must be the right house,
+because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was
+thatched with fur.  It was so large a house, that she did not
+like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand
+bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high:  even
+then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself
+`Suppose it should be raving mad after all!  I almost wish I'd
+gone to see the Hatter instead!'
+
+
+
+                           CHAPTER VII
+
+                         A Mad Tea-Party
+
+
+  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,
+and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a
+Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two
+were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and the
+talking over its head.  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,'
+thought Alice; `only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'
+
+  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded
+together at one corner of it:  `No room!  No room!' they cried
+out when they saw Alice coming.  `There's PLENTY of room!' said
+Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one
+end of the table.
+
+  `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
+
+  Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it
+but tea.  `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
+
+  `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
+
+  `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice
+angrily.
+
+  `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being
+invited,' said the March Hare.
+
+  `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a
+great many more than three.'
+
+  `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.  He had been
+looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was
+his first speech.
+
+  `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said
+with some severity; `it's very rude.'
+
+  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all
+he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'
+
+  `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad
+they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she
+added aloud.
+
+  `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'
+said the March Hare.
+
+  `Exactly so,' said Alice.
+
+  `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
+
+  `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what
+I say--that's the same thing, you know.'
+
+  `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter.  `You might just
+as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat
+what I see"!'
+
+  `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I
+like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'
+
+  `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to
+be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the
+same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'
+
+  `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
+conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,
+while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
+writing-desks, which wasn't much.
+
+  The Hatter was the first to break the silence.  `What day of
+the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice:  he had taken his
+watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking
+it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
+
+  Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'
+
+  `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.  `I told you butter
+wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March
+Hare.
+
+  `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.
+
+  `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter
+grumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'
+
+  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then
+he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he
+could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It
+was the BEST butter, you know.'
+
+  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.
+`What a funny watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the
+month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'
+
+  `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.  `Does YOUR watch tell
+you what year it is?'
+
+  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's
+because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'
+
+  `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.
+
+  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatter's remark seemed to
+have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
+`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she
+could.
+
+  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured
+a little hot tea upon its nose.
+
+  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without
+opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to
+remark myself.'
+
+  `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to
+Alice again.
+
+  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'
+
+  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.
+
+  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.
+
+  Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better
+with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that
+have no answers.'
+
+  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you
+wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'
+
+  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.
+
+  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head
+contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
+
+  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to
+beat time when I learn music.'
+
+  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand
+beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do
+almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose
+it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:
+you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
+clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'
+
+  (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a
+whisper.)
+
+  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:
+`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'
+
+  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep
+it to half-past one as long as you liked.'
+
+  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.
+
+  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' he replied.
+`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'
+(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the
+great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
+
+            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
+            How I wonder what you're at!"
+
+You know the song, perhaps?'
+
+  `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
+
+  `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--
+
+            "Up above the world you fly,
+            Like a tea-tray in the sky.
+                    Twinkle, twinkle--"'
+
+Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
+`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that
+they had to pinch it to make it stop.
+
+  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,
+`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the
+time!  Off with his head!"'
+
+  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.
+
+  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,
+`he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'
+
+  A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so
+many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.
+
+  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always
+tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'
+
+  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.
+
+  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'
+
+  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice
+ventured to ask.
+
+  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,
+yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady
+tells us a story.'
+
+  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at
+the proposal.
+
+  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,
+Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.
+
+  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he
+said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows
+were saying.'
+
+  `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.
+
+  `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.
+
+  `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep
+again before it's done.'
+
+  `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the
+Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,
+Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'
+
+  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great
+interest in questions of eating and drinking.
+
+  `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a
+minute or two.
+
+  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently
+remarked; `they'd have been ill.'
+
+  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'
+
+  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways
+of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went
+on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
+
+  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very
+earnestly.
+
+  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so
+I can't take more.'
+
+  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very
+easy to take MORE than nothing.'
+
+  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.
+
+  `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked
+triumphantly.
+
+  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped
+herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the
+Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the
+bottom of a well?'
+
+  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and
+then said, `It was a treacle-well.'
+
+  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but
+the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse
+sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the
+story for yourself.'
+
+  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt
+again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'
+
+  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he
+consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they
+were learning to draw, you know--'
+
+  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
+
+  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this
+time.
+
+  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move
+one place on.'
+
+  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the
+March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather
+unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the
+only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a
+good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset
+the milk-jug into his plate.
+
+  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began
+very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw
+the treacle from?'
+
+  `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so
+I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,
+stupid?'
+
+  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not
+choosing to notice this last remark.
+
+  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'
+
+  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse
+go on for some time without interrupting it.
+
+  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and
+rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew
+all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'
+
+  `Why with an M?' said Alice.
+
+  `Why not?' said the March Hare.
+
+  Alice was silent.
+
+  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going
+off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up
+again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an
+M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--
+you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever
+see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'
+
+  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I
+don't think--'
+
+  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
+
+  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got
+up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep
+instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her
+going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that
+they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were
+trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.
+
+  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she
+picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I
+ever was at in all my life!'
+
+  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a
+door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.
+`But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at
+once.'  And in she went.
+
+  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the
+little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' she
+said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and
+unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to
+work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her
+pocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the
+little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the
+beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool
+fountains.
+
+
+
+                          CHAPTER VIII
+
+                   The Queen's Croquet-Ground
+
+
+  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the
+roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at
+it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious
+thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up
+to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go
+splashing paint over me like that!'
+
+  `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged
+my elbow.'
+
+  On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always
+lay the blame on others!'
+
+  `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen say only
+yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'
+
+  `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.
+
+  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.
+
+  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it
+was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'
+
+  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all
+the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as
+she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the
+others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.
+
+  `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are
+painting those roses?'
+
+  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a
+low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to
+have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;
+and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads
+cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore
+she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously
+looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'
+and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
+their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice
+looked round, eager to see the Queen.
+
+  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped
+like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and
+feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were
+ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the
+soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were
+ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
+in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next
+came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice
+recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous
+manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
+noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the
+King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
+grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
+
+  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on
+her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember
+every having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,
+what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people
+had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see
+it?'  So she stood still where she was, and waited.
+
+  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped
+and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'
+She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in
+reply.
+
+  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,
+turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'
+
+  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very
+politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of
+cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'
+
+  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three
+gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as
+they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs
+was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether
+they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her
+own children.
+
+  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
+`It's no business of MINE.'
+
+  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her
+for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!
+Off--'
+
+  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the
+Queen was silent.
+
+  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said
+`Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'
+
+  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave
+`Turn them over!'
+
+  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
+
+  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the
+three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the
+King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.
+
+  `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'
+And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you
+been doing here?'
+
+  `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,
+going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'
+
+  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the
+roses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,
+three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
+gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.
+
+  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a
+large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered
+about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly
+marched off after the others.
+
+  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.
+
+  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers
+shouted in reply.
+
+  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'
+
+  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question
+was evidently meant for her.
+
+  `Yes!' shouted Alice.
+
+  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the
+procession, wondering very much what would happen next.
+
+  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.
+She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously
+into her face.
+
+  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'
+
+  `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He
+looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised
+himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and
+whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'
+
+  `What for?' said Alice.
+
+  `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.
+
+  `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.
+I said "What for?"'
+
+  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a
+little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a
+frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came
+rather late, and the Queen said--'
+
+  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,
+and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up
+against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or
+two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a
+curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and
+furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live
+flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
+stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
+
+  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
+flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,
+comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,
+but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
+out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it
+WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a
+puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:
+and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,
+it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
+itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,
+there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
+wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers
+were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
+ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
+difficult game indeed.
+
+  The players all played at once without waiting for turns,
+quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in
+a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went
+stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with
+her head!' about once in a minute.
+
+  Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as
+yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might
+happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of
+me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great
+wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'
+
+  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering
+whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a
+curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at
+first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to
+be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I
+shall have somebody to talk to.'
+
+  `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was
+mouth enough for it to speak with.
+
+  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no
+use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at
+least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,
+and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the
+game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The
+Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and
+no more of it appeared.
+
+  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather
+a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't
+hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in
+particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and
+you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;
+for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next
+walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have
+croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it
+saw mine coming!'
+
+  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.
+
+  `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then
+she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so
+she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while
+finishing the game.'
+
+  The Queen smiled and passed on.
+
+  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and
+looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.
+
+  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me
+to introduce it.'
+
+  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:  `however,
+it may kiss my hand if it likes.'
+
+  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
+
+  `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me
+like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.
+
+  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in
+some book, but I don't remember where.'
+
+  `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and
+he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I
+wish you would have this cat removed!'
+
+  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great
+or small.  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking
+round.
+
+  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and
+he hurried off.
+
+  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game
+was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,
+screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three
+of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and
+she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in
+such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or
+not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.
+
+  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,
+which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
+of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her
+flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where
+Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
+into a tree.
+
+  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,
+the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:
+`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches
+are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away
+under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for
+a little more conversation with her friend.
+
+  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to
+find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute
+going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who
+were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,
+and looked very uncomfortable.
+
+  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to
+settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,
+though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed
+to make out exactly what they said.
+
+  The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a
+head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had
+never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin
+at HIS time of life.
+
+  The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
+beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
+
+  The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about
+it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.
+(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so
+grave and anxious.)
+
+  Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the
+Duchess:  you'd better ask HER about it.'
+
+  `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `fetch
+her here.'  And the executioner went off like an arrow.
+
+   The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
+by the time he had come back with the Dutchess, it had entirely
+disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and
+down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.
+
+
+
+                           CHAPTER IX
+
+                     The Mock Turtle's Story
+
+
+  `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old
+thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately
+into Alice's, and they walked off together.
+
+  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and
+thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
+made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.
+
+  `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very
+hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT
+ALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that
+makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at
+having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them
+sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar
+and such things that make children sweet-tempered.  I only wish
+people knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you
+know--'
+
+  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a
+little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.
+`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you
+forget to talk.  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that
+is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'
+
+  `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.
+
+  `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a
+moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up
+closer to Alice's side as she spoke.
+
+  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,
+because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was
+exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,
+and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not
+like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.
+
+  `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of
+keeping up the conversation a little.
+
+  `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral of that is--"Oh,
+'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'
+
+  `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody
+minding their own business!'
+
+  `Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,
+digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,
+`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the
+sounds will take care of themselves."'
+
+  `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to
+herself.
+
+  `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your
+waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm
+doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the
+experiment?'
+
+  `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all
+anxious to have the experiment tried.
+
+  `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both
+bite.  And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock
+together."'
+
+  `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.
+
+  `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess:  `what a clear way you
+have of putting things!'
+
+  `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.
+
+  `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree
+to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near
+here.  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the
+less there is of yours."'
+
+  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this
+last remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look like one, but it
+is.'
+
+  `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of
+that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put
+more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than
+what it might appear to others that what you were or might have
+been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared
+to them to be otherwise."'
+
+  `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very
+politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it
+as you say it.'
+
+  `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess
+replied, in a pleased tone.
+
+  `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'
+said Alice.
+
+  `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess.  `I make you
+a present of everything I've said as yet.'
+
+  `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad they don't
+give birthday presents like that!'  But she did not venture to
+say it out loud.
+
+  `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her
+sharp little chin.
+
+  `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was
+beginning to feel a little worried.
+
+  `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to
+fly; and the m--'
+
+  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died
+away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the
+arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,
+and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,
+frowning like a thunderstorm.
+
+  `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak
+voice.
+
+  `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on
+the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,
+and that in about half no time!  Take your choice!'
+
+  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
+
+  `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice
+was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her
+back to the croquet-ground.
+
+  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,
+and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,
+they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a
+moment's delay would cost them their lives.
+
+  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off
+quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his
+head!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were
+taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave
+off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour
+or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the
+King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of
+execution.
+
+  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to
+Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'
+
+  `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'
+
+  `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.
+
+  `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.
+
+  `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his
+history,'
+
+  As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low
+voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come,
+THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite
+unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.
+
+  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the
+sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)
+`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to
+see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and
+see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,
+leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like
+the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would
+be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
+Queen:  so she waited.
+
+  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the
+Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'
+said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.
+
+  `What IS the fun?' said Alice.
+
+  `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they
+never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'
+
+  `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went
+slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,
+never!'
+
+  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
+distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,
+as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart
+would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she
+asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the
+same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got
+no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'
+
+  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with
+large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.
+
+  `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to
+know your history, she do.'
+
+  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow
+tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've
+finished.'
+
+  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice
+thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he
+doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.
+
+  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was
+a real Turtle.'
+
+  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only
+by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and
+the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very
+nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your
+interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be
+more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.
+
+  `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more
+calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to
+school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call
+him Tortoise--'
+
+  `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.
+
+  `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock
+Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!'
+
+  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
+question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and
+looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At
+last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!
+Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:
+
+  `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe
+it--'
+
+  `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.
+
+  `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
+
+  `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak
+again.  The Mock Turtle went on.
+
+  `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school
+every day--'
+
+  `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be
+so proud as all that.'
+
+  `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
+
+  `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'
+
+  `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.
+
+  `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.
+
+  `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock
+Turtle in a tone of great relief.  `Now at OURS they had at the
+end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'
+
+  `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the
+bottom of the sea.'
+
+  `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a
+sigh.  `I only took the regular course.'
+
+  `What was that?' inquired Alice.
+
+  `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock
+Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--
+Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'
+
+  `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.  `What
+is it?'
+
+  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  `What!  Never
+heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.  `You know what to beautify
+is, I suppose?'
+
+  `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--
+prettier.'
+
+  `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to
+uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'
+
+  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about
+it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you
+to learn?'
+
+  `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting
+off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,
+with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old
+conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us
+Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'
+
+  `What was THAT like?' said Alice.
+
+  `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said:  `I'm
+too stiff.  And the Gryphon never learnt it.'
+
+  `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon:  `I went to the Classics
+master, though.  He was an old crab, HE was.'
+
+  `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  `he
+taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'
+
+  `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;
+and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.
+
+  `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a
+hurry to change the subject.
+
+  `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the
+next, and so on.'
+
+  `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.
+
+  `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon
+remarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.'
+
+  This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a
+little before she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day
+must have been a holiday?'
+
+  `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
+
+  `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.
+
+  `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a
+very decided tone:  `tell her something about the games now.'

+                      The Lobster Quadrille
+
+
+  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper
+across his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for
+a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone
+in his throat,' said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him
+and punching him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered
+his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on
+again:--
+
+  `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,'
+said Alice)--`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
+(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,
+and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful
+thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'
+
+  `No, indeed,' said Alice.  `What sort of a dance is it?'
+
+  `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the
+sea-shore--'
+
+  `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon,
+and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of
+the way--'
+
+  `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.
+
+  `--you advance twice--'
+
+  `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.
+
+  `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said:  `advance twice, set to
+partners--'
+
+  `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the
+Gryphon.
+
+  `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'
+
+  `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
+
+  `--as far out to sea as you can--'
+
+  `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.
+
+  `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,
+capering wildly about.
+
+  `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the
+Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,
+who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat
+down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
+
+  `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.
+
+  `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.
+
+  `Very much indeed,' said Alice.
+
+  `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the
+Gryphon.  `We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall
+sing?'
+
+  `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.  `I've forgotten the words.'
+
+  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now
+and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and
+waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle
+sang this, very slowly and sadly:--
+
+
+`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
+"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my
+ tail.
+See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
+They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the
+dance?
+
+Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the
+dance?
+Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the
+dance?
+
+
+"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
+When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to
+                                                      sea!"
+But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look
+                                                       askance--
+Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the
+   dance.
+    Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join
+        the dance.
+    Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join
+        the dance.
+
+`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
+"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
+The further off from England the nearer is to France--
+Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
+
+    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the
+         dance?
+    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the
+         dance?"'
+
+
+
+  `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said
+Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so
+like that curious song about the whiting!'
+
+  `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've
+seen them, of course?'
+
+  `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she
+checked herself hastily.
+
+  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but
+if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're
+like.'
+
+  `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.  `They have their
+tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'
+
+  `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:
+`crumbs would all wash off in the sea.  But they HAVE their tails
+in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle
+yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all
+that,' he said to the Gryphon.
+
+  `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with
+the lobsters to the dance.  So they got thrown out to sea.  So
+they had to fall a long way.  So they got their tails fast in
+their mouths.  So they couldn't get them out again.  That's all.'
+
+  `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting.  I never knew
+so much about a whiting before.'
+
+  `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the
+Gryphon.  `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'
+
+  `I never thought about it,' said Alice.  `Why?'
+
+  `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very
+solemnly.
+
+  Alice was thoroughly puzzled.  `Does the boots and shoes!' she
+repeated in a wondering tone.
+
+  `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon.  `I
+mean, what makes them so shiny?'
+
+  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she
+gave her answer.  `They're done with blacking, I believe.'
+
+  `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep
+voice, `are done with a whiting.  Now you know.'
+
+  `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great
+curiosity.
+
+  `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather
+impatiently:  `any shrimp could have told you that.'
+
+  `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were
+still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep
+back, please:  we don't want YOU with us!"'
+
+  `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle
+said:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'
+
+  `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
+
+  `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:  `why, if a fish came
+to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With
+what porpoise?"'
+
+  `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.
+
+  `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended
+tone.  And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR
+adventures.'
+
+  `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'
+said Alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back to
+yesterday, because I was a different person then.'
+
+  `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.
+
+  `No, no!  The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an
+impatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.'
+
+  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when
+she first saw the White Rabbit.  She was a little nervous about
+it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on
+each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she
+gained courage as she went on.  Her listeners were perfectly
+quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,
+FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming
+different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said
+`That's very curious.'
+
+  `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.
+
+  `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated
+thoughtfully.  `I should like to hear her try and repeat
+something now.  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at the Gryphon as
+if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.
+
+  `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said
+the Gryphon.
+
+  `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat
+lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'
+However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so
+full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was
+saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--
+
+    `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
+    "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
+    As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
+    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'
+
+              [later editions continued as follows
+    When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
+    And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
+    But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
+    His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
+
+  `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'
+said the Gryphon.
+
+  `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it
+sounds uncommon nonsense.'
+
+  Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her
+hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way
+again.
+
+  `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.
+
+  `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily.  `Go on with
+the next verse.'
+
+  `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted.  `How COULD
+he turn them out with his nose, you know?'
+
+  `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was
+dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the
+subject.
+
+  `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:
+`it begins "I passed by his garden."'
+
+  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would
+all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--
+
+    `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
+    How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'
+
+        [later editions continued as follows
+    The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
+    While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
+    When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
+    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
+    While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
+    And concluded the banquet--]
+
+  `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle
+interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on?  It's by far
+the most confusing thing I ever heard!'
+
+  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon:  and
+Alice was only too glad to do so.
+
+  `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the
+Gryphon went on.  `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you
+a song?'
+
+  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'
+Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather
+offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes!  Sing her "Turtle
+Soup," will you, old fellow?'
+
+  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes
+choked with sobs, to sing this:--
+
+
+    `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
+    Waiting in a hot tureen!
+    Who for such dainties would not stoop?
+    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
+    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
+        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
+        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
+    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
+        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
+
+    `Beautiful Soup!  Who cares for fish,
+    Game, or any other dish?
+    Who would not give all else for two p
+    ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
+    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
+        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
+        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
+    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
+        Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'
+
+  `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had
+just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'
+was heard in the distance.
+
+  `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,
+it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.
+
+  `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon
+only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more
+faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the
+melancholy words:--
+
+    `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
+        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'
+
+
+
+                           CHAPTER XI
+
+                      Who Stole the Tarts?
+
+
+  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
+they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts
+of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:
+the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on
+each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,
+with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the
+other.  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large
+dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice
+quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'
+she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed
+to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
+her, to pass away the time.
+
+  Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had
+read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that
+she knew the name of nearly everything there.  `That's the
+judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'
+
+  The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown
+over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
+did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly
+not becoming.
+
+  `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve
+creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because
+some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they
+are the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three times over
+to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and
+rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the
+meaning of it at all.  However, `jury-men' would have done just
+as well.
+
+  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.
+`What are they doing?'  Alice whispered to the Gryphon.  `They
+can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'
+
+  `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in
+reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the
+trial.'
+
+  `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but
+she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in
+the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked
+anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
+
+  Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their
+shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'
+on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them
+didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his
+neighbour to tell him.  `A nice muddle their slates'll be in
+before the trial's over!' thought Alice.
+
+  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.  This of course,
+Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got
+behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it
+away.  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was
+Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of
+it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write
+with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very
+little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
+
+  `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.
+
+  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and
+then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--
+
+    `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
+          All on a summer day:
+      The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
+          And took them quite away!'
+
+  `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
+
+  `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted.  `There's
+a great deal to come before that!'
+
+  `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit
+blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First
+witness!'
+
+  The first witness was the Hatter.  He came in with a teacup in
+one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.  `I beg
+pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I
+hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'
+
+  `You ought to have finished,' said the King.  `When did you
+begin?'
+
+  The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into
+the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.  `Fourteenth of March, I
+think it was,' he said.
+
+  `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
+
+  `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
+
+  `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury
+eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then
+added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
+
+  `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
+
+  `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
+
+  `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who
+instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
+
+  `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;
+`I've none of my own.  I'm a hatter.'
+
+  Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the
+Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.
+
+  `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or
+I'll have you executed on the spot.'
+
+  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept
+shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the
+Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his
+teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.
+
+  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which
+puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she was
+beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she
+would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she
+decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for
+her.
+
+  `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was
+sitting next to her.  `I can hardly breathe.'
+
+  `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.'
+
+  `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.
+
+  `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly:  `you know
+you're growing too.'
+
+  `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:
+`not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily
+and crossed over to the other side of the court.
+
+  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the
+Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to
+one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the
+singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter
+trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
+
+  `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have
+you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'
+
+  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a
+trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week
+or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and
+the twinkling of the tea--'
+
+  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.
+
+  `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
+
+  `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.
+`Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on!'
+
+  `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things
+twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'
+
+  `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
+
+  `You did!' said the Hatter.
+
+  `I deny it!' said the March Hare.
+
+  `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.'
+
+  `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,
+looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the
+Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.
+
+  `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-
+and-butter--'
+
+  `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.
+
+  `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
+
+  `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you
+executed.'
+
+  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,
+and went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he
+began.
+
+  `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.
+
+  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately
+suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a
+hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had
+a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:
+into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat
+upon it.)
+
+  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often
+read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some
+attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the
+officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant
+till now.'
+
+  `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'
+continued the King.
+
+  `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as
+it is.'
+
+  `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.
+
+  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
+
+  `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.  `Now we
+shall get on better.'
+
+  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious
+look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
+
+  `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the
+court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.
+
+  `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one
+of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the
+officer could get to the door.
+
+  `Call the next witness!' said the King.
+
+  The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the
+pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before
+she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began
+sneezing all at once.
+
+  `Give your evidence,' said the King.
+
+  `Shan't,' said the cook.
+
+  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a
+low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'
+
+  `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy
+air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
+his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What
+are tarts made of?'
+
+  `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
+
+  `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.
+
+  `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that
+Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch
+him!  Off with his whiskers!'
+
+  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the
+Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down
+again, the cook had disappeared.
+
+  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.
+`Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the
+Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
+It quite makes my forehead ache!'
+
+  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,
+feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,
+`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.
+Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top
+of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'

+  `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the
+moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
+jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with
+the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
+of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
+her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
+the week before.
+
+  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great
+dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,
+for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and
+she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
+and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.
+
+  `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave
+voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--
+ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as
+he said do.
+
+  Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she
+had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing
+was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
+to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that
+it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it
+would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'
+
+  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
+being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and
+handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write
+out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed
+too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,
+gazing up into the roof of the court.
+
+  `What do you know about this business?' the King said to
+Alice.
+
+  `Nothing,' said Alice.
+
+  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.
+
+  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
+
+  `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.
+They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when
+the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,
+of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and
+making faces at him as he spoke.
+
+  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and
+went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--
+unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word
+sounded best.
+
+  Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some
+`unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to
+look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she
+thought to herself.
+
+  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily
+writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out
+from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
+HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'
+
+  Everybody looked at Alice.
+
+  `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.
+
+  `You are,' said the King.
+
+  `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
+
+  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides,
+that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'
+
+  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
+
+  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
+
+  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.
+`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling
+voice.
+
+  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said
+the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has
+just been picked up.'
+
+  `What's in it?' said the Queen.
+
+  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems
+to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
+
+  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was
+written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
+
+  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
+
+  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,
+there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper
+as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set
+of verses.'
+
+  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of
+they jurymen.
+
+  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the
+queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)
+
+  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.
+(The jury all brightened up again.)
+
+  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and
+they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'
+
+  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the
+matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd
+have signed your name like an honest man.'
+
+  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the
+first really clever thing the King had said that day.
+
+  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
+
+  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't
+even know what they're about!'
+
+  `Read them,' said the King.
+
+  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,
+please your Majesty?' he asked.
+
+  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on
+till you come to the end:  then stop.'
+
+  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--
+
+        `They told me you had been to her,
+          And mentioned me to him:
+        She gave me a good character,
+          But said I could not swim.
+
+        He sent them word I had not gone
+          (We know it to be true):
+        If she should push the matter on,
+          What would become of you?
+
+        I gave her one, they gave him two,
+          You gave us three or more;
+        They all returned from him to you,
+          Though they were mine before.
+
+        If I or she should chance to be
+          Involved in this affair,
+        He trusts to you to set them free,
+          Exactly as we were.
+
+        My notion was that you had been
+          (Before she had this fit)
+        An obstacle that came between
+          Him, and ourselves, and it.
+
+        Don't let him know she liked them best,
+          For this must ever be
+        A secret, kept from all the rest,
+          Between yourself and me.'
+
+  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'
+said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'
+
+  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had
+grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit
+afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't
+believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'
+
+  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe
+there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to
+explain the paper.
+
+  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a
+world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And
+yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his
+knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some
+meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you
+can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.
+
+  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.
+(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)
+
+  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering
+over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's
+the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,
+that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'
+
+  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said
+Alice.
+
+  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to
+the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
+Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my
+dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.
+
+  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
+Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off
+writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
+mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
+trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
+
+  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round
+the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.
+
+  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and
+everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the
+King said, for about the twentieth time that day.
+
+  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
+
+  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having
+the sentence first!'
+
+  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.
+
+  `I won't!' said Alice.
+
+  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
+Nobody moved.
+
+  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full
+size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'
+
+  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
+down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half
+of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
+the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
+brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
+trees upon her face.
+
+  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long
+sleep you've had!'
+
+  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told
+her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
+Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and
+when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a
+curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's
+getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
+ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
+
+  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
+head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
+little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
+dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--
+
+  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
+tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
+were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her
+voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
+the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and
+still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
+around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
+sister's dream.
+
+  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
+by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
+neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as
+the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
+and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
+guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
+Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once
+more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's
+slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
+filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
+Mock Turtle.
+
+  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
+Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
+all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only
+rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
+reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-
+bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
+boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
+all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
+confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the
+cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
+heavy sobs.
+
+  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
+hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
+she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
+loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about
+her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
+with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
+Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their
+simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
+remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
+
+                             THE END

+
+
+
+SCENE I	Orchard of Oliver's house.
+
+
+	[Enter ORLANDO and ADAM]
+
+ORLANDO	As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
+	bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
+	and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
+	blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
+	sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
+	report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
+	he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
+	properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
+	that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
+	differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
+	are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
+	with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
+	and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
+	brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
+	which his animals on his dunghills are as much
+	bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
+	plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
+	me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
+	me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
+	brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
+	gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
+	grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
+	think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
+	servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
+	know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
+
+ADAM	Yonder comes my master, your brother.
+
+ORLANDO	Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
+	shake me up.
+
+	[Enter OLIVER]
+
+OLIVER	Now, sir! what make you here?
+
+ORLANDO	Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
+
+OLIVER	What mar you then, sir?
+
+ORLANDO	Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
+	made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
+
+OLIVER	Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
+
+ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
+	What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
+	come to such penury?
+
+OLIVER	Know you where your are, sir?
+
+ORLANDO	O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
+
+OLIVER	Know you before whom, sir?
+
+ORLANDO	Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
+	you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
+	condition of blood, you should so know me. The
+	courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
+	you are the first-born; but the same tradition
+	takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
+	betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
+	you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
+	nearer to his reverence.
+
+OLIVER	What, boy!
+
+ORLANDO	Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
+
+OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
+
+ORLANDO	I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
+	Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
+	a villain that says such a father begot villains.
+	Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
+	from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
+	tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
+
+ADAM	Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
+	remembrance, be at accord.
+
+OLIVER	Let me go, I say.
+
+ORLANDO	I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
+	father charged you in his will to give me good
+	education: you have trained me like a peasant,
+	obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
+	qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
+	me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
+	me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
+	give me the poor allottery my father left me by
+	testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
+
+OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
+	Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
+	with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
+	pray you, leave me.
+
+ORLANDO	I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
+
+OLIVER	Get you with him, you old dog.
+
+ADAM	Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
+	teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
+	he would not have spoke such a word.
+
+	[Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM]
+
+OLIVER	Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
+	physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
+	crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!
+
+	[Enter DENNIS]
+
+DENNIS	Calls your worship?
+
+OLIVER	Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
+
+DENNIS	So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
+	access to you.
+
+OLIVER	Call him in.
+
+	[Exit DENNIS]
+
+	'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.
+
+	[Enter CHARLES]
+
+CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship.
+
+OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
+	new court?
+
+CHARLES	There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
+	that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
+	brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
+	have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
+	whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
+	therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
+
+OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
+	banished with her father?
+
+CHARLES	O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
+	her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
+	that she would have followed her exile, or have died
+	to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
+	less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
+	never two ladies loved as they do.
+
+OLIVER	Where will the old duke live?
+
+CHARLES	They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
+	a many merry men with him; and there they live like
+	the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
+	gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
+	carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
+
+OLIVER	What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
+
+CHARLES	Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
+	matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
+	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
+	to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
+	To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
+	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
+	well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
+	for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
+	must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
+	out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
+	withal, that either you might stay him from his
+	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
+	run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
+	and altogether against my will.
+
+OLIVER	Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
+	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
+	myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
+	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
+	it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
+	it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
+	of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
+	good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
+	me his natural brother: therefore use thy
+	discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
+	as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
+	thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
+	mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
+	against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
+	treacherous device and never leave thee till he
+	hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
+	for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
+	it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
+	day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
+	should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
+	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
+
+CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
+	to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
+	alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
+	so God keep your worship!
+
+OLIVER	Farewell, good Charles.
+
+	[Exit CHARLES]
+
+	Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
+	an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
+	hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
+	schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
+	all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
+	in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
+	people, who best know him, that I am altogether
+	misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
+	wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
+	I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.
+
+	[Exit]
+

+
+
+ACT I
+
+
+
+SCENE II	Lawn before the Duke's palace.
+
+
+	[Enter CELIA and ROSALIND]
+
+CELIA	I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
+
+ROSALIND	Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
+	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
+	teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
+	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
+
+CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
+	that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
+	had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
+	hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
+	love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
+	if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
+	tempered as mine is to thee.
+
+ROSALIND	Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
+	rejoice in yours.
+
+CELIA	You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
+	like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
+	be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
+	father perforce, I will render thee again in
+	affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
+	that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
+	sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
+
+ROSALIND	From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
+	me see; what think you of falling in love?
+
+CELIA	Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
+	love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
+	neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
+	in honour come off again.
+
+ROSALIND	What shall be our sport, then?
+
+CELIA	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
+	her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
+
+ROSALIND	I would we could do so, for her benefits are
+	mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
+	doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
+
+CELIA	'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
+	makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
+	makes very ill-favouredly.
+
+ROSALIND	Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
+	Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
+	not in the lineaments of Nature.
+
+	[Enter TOUCHSTONE]
+
+CELIA	No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
+	not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
+	hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
+	Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
+
+ROSALIND	Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
+	Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
+	Nature's wit.
+
+CELIA	Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
+	Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
+	to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
+	natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
+	the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
+	wit! whither wander you?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Mistress, you must come away to your father.
+
+CELIA	Were you made the messenger?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
+
+ROSALIND	Where learned you that oath, fool?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
+	were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
+	mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
+	pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
+	yet was not the knight forsworn.
+
+CELIA	How prove you that, in the great heap of your
+	knowledge?
+
+ROSALIND	Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
+	swear by your beards that I am a knave.
+
+CELIA	By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
+	swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
+	more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
+	never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
+	before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
+
+CELIA	Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
+
+CELIA	My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
+	speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
+	one of these days.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
+	wise men do foolishly.
+
+CELIA	By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
+	wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
+	that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
+	Monsieur Le Beau.
+
+ROSALIND	With his mouth full of news.
+
+CELIA	Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
+
+ROSALIND	Then shall we be news-crammed.
+
+CELIA	All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
+
+	[Enter LE BEAU]
+
+	Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?
+
+LE BEAU	Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
+
+CELIA	Sport! of what colour?
+
+LE BEAU	What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?
+
+ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decree.
+
+CELIA	Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
+
+ROSALIND	Thou losest thy old smell.
+
+LE BEAU	You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
+	wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
+
+ROSALIND	You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
+
+LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
+	your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
+	yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
+	to perform it.
+
+CELIA	Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
+
+LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons,--
+
+CELIA	I could match this beginning with an old tale.
+
+LE BEAU	Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
+
+ROSALIND	With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
+	by these presents.'
+
+LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
+	duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
+	and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
+	hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
+	so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
+	their father, making such pitiful dole over them
+	that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
+
+ROSALIND	Alas!
+
+TOUCHSTONE	But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
+	have lost?
+
+LE BEAU	Why, this that I speak of.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
+	time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
+	for ladies.
+
+CELIA	Or I, I promise thee.
+
+ROSALIND	But is there any else longs to see this broken music
+	in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
+	rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
+
+LE BEAU	You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
+	appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
+	perform it.
+
+CELIA	Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.
+
+	[Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO,
+	CHARLES, and Attendants]
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
+	own peril on his forwardness.
+
+ROSALIND	Is yonder the man?
+
+LE BEAU	Even he, madam.
+
+CELIA	Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
+	to see the wrestling?
+
+ROSALIND	Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
+	there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
+	challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
+	will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
+	you can move him.
+
+CELIA	Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	Do so: I'll not be by.
+
+LE BEAU	Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.
+
+ORLANDO	I attend them with all respect and duty.
+
+ROSALIND	Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
+
+ORLANDO	No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
+	come but in, as others do, to try with him the
+	strength of my youth.
+
+CELIA	Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
+	years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
+	strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
+	knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
+	adventure would counsel you to a more equal
+	enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
+	embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
+
+ROSALIND	Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
+	be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
+	that the wrestling might not go forward.
+
+ORLANDO	I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
+	thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
+	so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
+	your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
+	trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
+	shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
+	dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
+	friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
+	world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
+	the world I fill up a place, which may be better
+	supplied when I have made it empty.
+
+ROSALIND	The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
+
+CELIA	And mine, to eke out hers.
+
+ROSALIND	Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
+
+CELIA	Your heart's desires be with you!
+
+CHARLES	Come, where is this young gallant that is so
+	desirous to lie with his mother earth?
+
+ORLANDO	Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	You shall try but one fall.
+
+CHARLES	No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
+	to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
+	from a first.
+
+ORLANDO	An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
+	mocked me before: but come your ways.
+
+ROSALIND	Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!
+
+CELIA	I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
+	fellow by the leg.
+
+	[They wrestle]
+
+ROSALIND	O excellent young man!
+
+CELIA	If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
+	should down.
+
+	[Shout. CHARLES is thrown]
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	No more, no more.
+
+ORLANDO	Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	How dost thou, Charles?
+
+LE BEAU	He cannot speak, my lord.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
+
+ORLANDO	Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
+	The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
+	But I did find him still mine enemy:
+	Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
+	Hadst thou descended from another house.
+	But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
+	I would thou hadst told me of another father.
+
+	[Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU]
+
+CELIA	Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
+
+ORLANDO	I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
+	His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
+	To be adopted heir to Frederick.
+
+ROSALIND	My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
+	And all the world was of my father's mind:
+	Had I before known this young man his son,
+	I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
+	Ere he should thus have ventured.
+
+CELIA	Gentle cousin,
+	Let us go thank him and encourage him:
+	My father's rough and envious disposition
+	Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
+	If you do keep your promises in love
+	But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
+	Your mistress shall be happy.
+
+ROSALIND	Gentleman,
+
+	[Giving him a chain from her neck]
+
+	Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
+	That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
+	Shall we go, coz?
+
+CELIA	                  Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
+
+ORLANDO	Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
+	Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
+	Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
+
+ROSALIND	He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
+	I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
+	Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
+	More than your enemies.
+
+CELIA	Will you go, coz?
+
+ROSALIND	Have with you. Fare you well.
+
+	[Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA]
+
+ORLANDO	What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
+	I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
+	O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
+	Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
+
+	[Re-enter LE BEAU]
+
+LE BEAU	Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
+	To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
+	High commendation, true applause and love,
+	Yet such is now the duke's condition
+	That he misconstrues all that you have done.
+	The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
+	More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
+
+ORLANDO	I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
+	Which of the two was daughter of the duke
+	That here was at the wrestling?
+
+LE BEAU	Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
+	But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
+	The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
+	And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
+	To keep his daughter company; whose loves
+	Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
+	But I can tell you that of late this duke
+	Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
+	Grounded upon no other argument
+	But that the people praise her for her virtues
+	And pity her for her good father's sake;
+	And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
+	Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
+	Hereafter, in a better world than this,
+	I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
+
+ORLANDO	I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
+
+	[Exit LE BEAU]
+
+	Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
+	From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
+	But heavenly Rosalind!
+
+	[Exit]

+
+
+ACT I
+
+
+
+SCENE III	A room in the palace.
+
+
+	[Enter CELIA and ROSALIND]
+
+CELIA	Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?
+
+ROSALIND	Not one to throw at a dog.
+
+CELIA	No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
+	curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
+
+ROSALIND	Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
+	should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
+	without any.
+
+CELIA	But is all this for your father?
+
+ROSALIND	No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
+	full of briers is this working-day world!
+
+CELIA	They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
+	holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
+	paths our very petticoats will catch them.
+
+ROSALIND	I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
+
+CELIA	Hem them away.
+
+ROSALIND	I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
+
+CELIA	Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
+
+ROSALIND	O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!
+
+CELIA	O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
+	despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
+	service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
+	possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
+	strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
+
+ROSALIND	The duke my father loved his father dearly.
+
+CELIA	Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
+	dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
+	for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
+	not Orlando.
+
+ROSALIND	No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
+
+CELIA	Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
+
+ROSALIND	Let me love him for that, and do you love him
+	because I do. Look, here comes the duke.
+
+CELIA	With his eyes full of anger.
+
+	[Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords]
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
+	And get you from our court.
+
+ROSALIND	Me, uncle?
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	You, cousin
+	Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
+	So near our public court as twenty miles,
+	Thou diest for it.
+
+ROSALIND	                  I do beseech your grace,
+	Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
+	If with myself I hold intelligence
+	Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
+	If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
+	As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
+	Never so much as in a thought unborn
+	Did I offend your highness.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	Thus do all traitors:
+	If their purgation did consist in words,
+	They are as innocent as grace itself:
+	Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
+
+ROSALIND	Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
+	Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
+
+ROSALIND	So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
+	So was I when your highness banish'd him:
+	Treason is not inherited, my lord;
+	Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
+	What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
+	Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
+	To think my poverty is treacherous.
+
+CELIA	Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
+	Else had she with her father ranged along.
+
+CELIA	I did not then entreat to have her stay;
+	It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
+	I was too young that time to value her;
+	But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
+	Why so am I; we still have slept together,
+	Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
+	And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
+	Still we went coupled and inseparable.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
+	Her very silence and her patience
+	Speak to the people, and they pity her.
+	Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
+	And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
+	When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
+	Firm and irrevocable is my doom
+	Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
+
+CELIA	Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
+	I cannot live out of her company.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
+	If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
+	And in the greatness of my word, you die.
+
+	[Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords]
+
+CELIA	O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
+	Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
+	I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
+
+ROSALIND	I have more cause.
+
+CELIA	                  Thou hast not, cousin;
+	Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
+	Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
+
+ROSALIND	That he hath not.
+
+CELIA	No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
+	Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
+	Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
+	No: let my father seek another heir.
+	Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
+	Whither to go and what to bear with us;
+	And do not seek to take your change upon you,
+	To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
+	For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
+	Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
+
+ROSALIND	Why, whither shall we go?
+
+CELIA	To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
+
+ROSALIND	Alas, what danger will it be to us,
+	Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
+	Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
+
+CELIA	I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
+	And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
+	The like do you: so shall we pass along
+	And never stir assailants.
+
+ROSALIND	Were it not better,
+	Because that I am more than common tall,
+	That I did suit me all points like a man?
+	A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
+	A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
+	Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
+	We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
+	As many other mannish cowards have
+	That do outface it with their semblances.
+
+CELIA	What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
+
+ROSALIND	I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
+	And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
+	But what will you be call'd?
+
+CELIA	Something that hath a reference to my state
+	No longer Celia, but Aliena.
+
+ROSALIND	But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
+	The clownish fool out of your father's court?
+	Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
+
+CELIA	He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
+	Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
+	And get our jewels and our wealth together,
+	Devise the fittest time and safest way
+	To hide us from pursuit that will be made
+	After my flight. Now go we in content
+	To liberty and not to banishment.
+

+ACT II
+
+
+
+SCENE I	The Forest of Arden.
+
+
+	[Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,
+	like foresters]
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
+	Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
+	Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
+	More free from peril than the envious court?
+	Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
+	The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
+	And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
+	Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
+	Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
+	'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
+	That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
+	Sweet are the uses of adversity,
+	Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
+	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
+	And this our life exempt from public haunt
+	Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
+	Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
+	I would not change it.
+
+AMIENS	Happy is your grace,
+	That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
+	Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
+	And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
+	Being native burghers of this desert city,
+	Should in their own confines with forked heads
+	Have their round haunches gored.
+
+First Lord	Indeed, my lord,
+	The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
+	And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
+	Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
+	To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
+	Did steal behind him as he lay along
+	Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
+	Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
+	To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
+	That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
+	Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
+	The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
+	That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
+	Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
+	Coursed one another down his innocent nose
+	In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
+	Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
+	Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
+	Augmenting it with tears.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	But what said Jaques?
+	Did he not moralize this spectacle?
+
+First Lord	O, yes, into a thousand similes.
+	First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
+	'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
+	As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
+	To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
+	Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
+	''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
+	The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
+	Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
+	And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
+	'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
+	'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
+	Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
+	Thus most invectively he pierceth through
+	The body of the country, city, court,
+	Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
+	Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
+	To fright the animals and to kill them up
+	In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	And did you leave him in this contemplation?
+
+Second Lord	We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
+	Upon the sobbing deer.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Show me the place:
+	I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
+	For then he's full of matter.
+
+First Lord	I'll bring you to him straight.

+
+
+SCENE II	A room in the palace.
+
+
+	[Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords]
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	Can it be possible that no man saw them?
+	It cannot be: some villains of my court
+	Are of consent and sufferance in this.
+
+First Lord	I cannot hear of any that did see her.
+	The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
+	Saw her abed, and in the morning early
+	They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
+
+Second Lord	My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
+	Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
+	Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
+	Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
+	Your daughter and her cousin much commend
+	The parts and graces of the wrestler
+	That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
+	And she believes, wherever they are gone,
+	That youth is surely in their company.
+
+DUKE FREDERICK	Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
+	If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
+	I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
+	And let not search and inquisition quail
+	To bring again these foolish runaways.

+
+ORLANDO	Who's there?
+
+ADAM	What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
+	O my sweet master! O you memory
+	Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
+	Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
+	And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
+	Why would you be so fond to overcome
+	The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
+	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
+	Know you not, master, to some kind of men
+	Their graces serve them but as enemies?
+	No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
+	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
+	O, what a world is this, when what is comely
+	Envenoms him that bears it!
+
+ORLANDO	Why, what's the matter?

+ADAM	O unhappy youth!
+	Come not within these doors; within this roof
+	The enemy of all your graces lives:
+	Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
+	Yet not the son, I will not call him son
+	Of him I was about to call his father--
+	Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
+	To burn the lodging where you use to lie
+	And you within it: if he fail of that,
+	He will have other means to cut you off.
+	I overheard him and his practises.
+	This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
+	Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
+
+ORLANDO	Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
+
+ADAM	No matter whither, so you come not here.
+
+ORLANDO	What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
+	Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
+	A thievish living on the common road?
+	This I must do, or know not what to do:
+	Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
+	I rather will subject me to the malice
+	Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
+
+ADAM	But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
+	The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
+	Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
+	When service should in my old limbs lie lame
+	And unregarded age in corners thrown:
+	Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
+	Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
+	Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
+	And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
+	Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
+	For in my youth I never did apply
+	Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
+	Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
+	The means of weakness and debility;
+	Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
+	Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
+	I'll do the service of a younger man
+	In all your business and necessities.
+
+ORLANDO	O good old man, how well in thee appears
+	The constant service of the antique world,
+	When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
+	Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
+	Where none will sweat but for promotion,
+	And having that, do choke their service up
+	Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
+	But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
+	That cannot so much as a blossom yield
+	In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
+	But come thy ways; well go along together,
+	And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
+	We'll light upon some settled low content.
+
+ADAM	Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
+	To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
+	From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
+	Here lived I, but now live here no more.
+	At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
+	But at fourscore it is too late a week:
+	Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
+	Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

+
+ROSALIND	O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
+
+TOUCHSTONE	I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
+
+ROSALIND	I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
+	apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort
+	the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show
+	itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,
+	good Aliena!
+
+CELIA	I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear
+	you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,
+	for I think you have no money in your purse.
+
+ROSALIND	Well, this is the forest of Arden.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was
+	at home, I was in a better place: but travellers
+	must be content.
+
+ROSALIND	Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
+
+	[Enter CORIN and SILVIUS]
+
+	Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in
+	solemn talk.
+
+CORIN	That is the way to make her scorn you still.
+
+SILVIUS	O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
+
+CORIN	I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.
+
+SILVIUS	No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
+	Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
+	As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:
+	But if thy love were ever like to mine--
+	As sure I think did never man love so--
+	How many actions most ridiculous
+	Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
+
+CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
+
+SILVIUS	O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!
+	If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
+	That ever love did make thee run into,
+	Thou hast not loved:
+	Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
+	Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
+	Thou hast not loved:
+	Or if thou hast not broke from company
+	Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
+	Thou hast not loved.
+	O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!
+
+	[Exit]
+
+ROSALIND	Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
+	I have by hard adventure found mine own.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke
+	my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
+	coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
+	kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
+	pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
+	wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took
+	two cods and, giving her them again, said with
+	weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
+	true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
+	mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
+
+ROSALIND	Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I
+	break my shins against it.
+
+ROSALIND	Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
+	Is much upon my fashion.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
+
+CELIA	I pray you, one of you question yond man
+	If he for gold will give us any food:
+	I faint almost to death.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Holla, you clown!
+
+ROSALIND	Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.
+
+CORIN	Who calls?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Your betters, sir.
+
+CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched.
+
+ROSALIND	Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
+
+CORIN	And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
+
+ROSALIND	I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
+	Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
+	Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
+	Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
+	And faints for succor.
+
+CORIN	Fair sir, I pity her
+	And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
+	My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
+	But I am shepherd to another man
+	And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
+	My master is of churlish disposition
+	And little recks to find the way to heaven
+	By doing deeds of hospitality:
+	Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
+	Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
+	By reason of his absence, there is nothing
+	That you will feed on; but what is, come see.
+	And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
+
+ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
+
+CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
+	That little cares for buying any thing.
+
+ROSALIND	I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
+	Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
+	And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
+
+CELIA	And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
+	And willingly could waste my time in it.
+
+CORIN	Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
+	Go with me: if you like upon report
+	The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
+	I will your very faithful feeder be
+	And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

+
+JAQUES	More, more, I prithee, more.
+
+AMIENS	It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
+
+JAQUES	I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
+	melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
+	More, I prithee, more.
+
+AMIENS	My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.
+
+JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
+	sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?
+
+AMIENS	What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
+
+JAQUES	Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me
+	nothing. Will you sing?
+
+AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself.
+
+JAQUES	Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;
+	but that they call compliment is like the encounter
+	of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
+	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
+	the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will
+	not, hold your tongues.
+
+AMIENS	Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the
+	duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
+	this day to look you.
+
+JAQUES	And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
+	too disputable for my company: I think of as many

+
+AMIENS	What's that 'ducdame'?

+	If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I

+
+
+	[A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and
+	Lords like outlaws]
+
+DUKE SENIOR	I think he be transform'd into a beast;
+	For I can no where find him like a man.
+
+First Lord	My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
+	Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
+	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
+	Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.
+
+	[Enter JAQUES]
+
+First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
+	That your poor friends must woo your company?
+	What, you look merrily!
+
+JAQUES	A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
+	A motley fool; a miserable world!
+	As I do live by food, I met a fool
+	Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
+	And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
+	In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
+	'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
+	'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
+	And then he drew a dial from his poke,
+	And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
+	Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
+	Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
+	'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
+	And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
+	And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
+	And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
+	And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
+	The motley fool thus moral on the time,
+	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
+	That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
+	And I did laugh sans intermission
+	An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
+	A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?
+
+JAQUES	O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
+	And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
+	They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
+	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
+	After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
+	With observation, the which he vents
+	In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
+	I am ambitious for a motley coat.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one.
+
+JAQUES	It is my only suit;
+	Provided that you weed your better judgments
+	Of all opinion that grows rank in them
+	That I am wise. I must have liberty
+	Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
+	To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
+	And they that are most galled with my folly,
+	They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
+	The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
+	He that a fool doth very wisely hit
+	Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
+	Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
+	The wise man's folly is anatomized
+	Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
+	Invest me in my motley; give me leave
+	To speak my mind, and I will through and through
+	Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
+	If they will patiently receive my medicine.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
+
+JAQUES	What, for a counter, would I do but good?
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
+	For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
+	As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
+	And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
+	That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
+	Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
+
+JAQUES	Why, who cries out on pride,
+	That can therein tax any private party?
+	Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
+	Till that the weary very means do ebb?
+	What woman in the city do I name,
+	When that I say the city-woman bears
+	The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
+	Who can come in and say that I mean her,
+	When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
+	Or what is he of basest function
+	That says his bravery is not of my cost,
+	Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
+	His folly to the mettle of my speech?
+	There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
+	My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
+	Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
+	Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
+	Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
+
+	[Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn]
+
+ORLANDO	Forbear, and eat no more.
+
+JAQUES	Why, I have eat none yet.
+
+ORLANDO	Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.
+
+JAQUES	Of what kind should this cock come of?
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
+	Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
+	That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
+
+ORLANDO	You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
+	Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
+	Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
+	And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
+	He dies that touches any of this fruit
+	Till I and my affairs are answered.
+
+JAQUES	An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
+	More than your force move us to gentleness.
+
+ORLANDO	I almost die for food; and let me have it.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
+
+ORLANDO	Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
+	I thought that all things had been savage here;
+	And therefore put I on the countenance
+	Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
+	That in this desert inaccessible,
+	Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
+	Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
+	If ever you have look'd on better days,
+	If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
+	If ever sat at any good man's feast,
+	If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
+	And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
+	Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
+	In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	True is it that we have seen better days,
+	And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
+	And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
+	Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
+	And therefore sit you down in gentleness
+	And take upon command what help we have
+	That to your wanting may be minister'd.
+
+ORLANDO	Then but forbear your food a little while,
+	Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
+	And give it food. There is an old poor man,
+	Who after me hath many a weary step
+	Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
+	Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
+	I will not touch a bit.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Go find him out,
+	And we will nothing waste till you return.
+
+ORLANDO	I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
+
+	[Exit]
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
+	This wide and universal theatre
+	Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
+	Wherein we play in.
+
+JAQUES	All the world's a stage,
+	And all the men and women merely players:
+	They have their exits and their entrances;
+	And one man in his time plays many parts,
+	His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
+	Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
+	And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
+	And shining morning face, creeping like snail
+	Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
+	Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
+	Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
+	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
+	Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
+	Seeking the bubble reputation
+	Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
+	In fair round belly with good capon lined,
+	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
+	Full of wise saws and modern instances;
+	And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
+	Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
+	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
+	His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
+	For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
+	Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
+	And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
+	That ends this strange eventful history,
+	Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
+	Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
+
+	[Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM]
+

+	And let him feed.
+
+ORLANDO	I thank you most for him.

+	Thou art not so unkind
+	As man's ingratitude;
+	Thy tooth is not so keen,
+	Because thou art not seen,
+	Although thy breath be rude.
+	Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
+	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
+	Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
+	This life is most jolly.
+	Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
+	That dost not bite so nigh
+	As benefits forgot:
+	Though thou the waters warp,
+	Thy sting is not so sharp
+	As friend remember'd not.
+	Heigh-ho! sing, &c.

+	That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,

+
+	[Exit]
+
+	[Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE]
+
+CORIN	And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
+	life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
+	it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
+	like it very well; but in respect that it is
+	private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
+	is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
+	respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
+	is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
+	but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
+	against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
+
+CORIN	No more but that I know the more one sickens the
+	worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
+	means and content is without three good friends;
+	that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
+	burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
+	great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
+	he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
+	complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
+	court, shepherd?
+
+CORIN	No, truly.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Then thou art damned.
+
+CORIN	Nay, I hope.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all
+	on one side.
+
+CORIN	For not being at court? Your reason.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
+	good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
+	then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
+	sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
+	state, shepherd.
+
+CORIN	Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
+	at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
+	behavior of the country is most mockable at the
+	court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
+	you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
+	uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Instance, briefly; come, instance.
+
+CORIN	Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
+	fells, you know, are greasy.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
+	the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
+	a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
+
+CORIN	Besides, our hands are hard.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
+	A more sounder instance, come.
+
+CORIN	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
+	our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
+	courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
+	good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
+	perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
+	very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
+
+CORIN	You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
+	God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
+
+CORIN	Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
+	that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
+	happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
+	harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
+	graze and my lambs suck.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
+	and the rams together and to offer to get your
+	living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
+	bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
+	twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
+	out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
+	damned for this, the devil himself will have no
+	shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
+	'scape.
+
+CORIN	Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.
+
+	[Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading]
+
+ROSALIND	     From the east to western Ind,
+	No jewel is like Rosalind.
+	Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
+	Through all the world bears Rosalind.
+	All the pictures fairest lined
+	Are but black to Rosalind.
+	Let no fair be kept in mind
+	But the fair of Rosalind.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and
+	suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
+	right butter-women's rank to market.
+
+ROSALIND	Out, fool!
+
+TOUCHSTONE	For a taste:
+	If a hart do lack a hind,
+	Let him seek out Rosalind.
+	If the cat will after kind,
+	So be sure will Rosalind.
+	Winter garments must be lined,
+	So must slender Rosalind.
+	They that reap must sheaf and bind;
+	Then to cart with Rosalind.
+	Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
+	Such a nut is Rosalind.
+	He that sweetest rose will find
+	Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
+	This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
+	infect yourself with them?
+
+ROSALIND	Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
+
+ROSALIND	I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
+	with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
+	i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
+	ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the
+	forest judge.
+
+	[Enter CELIA, with a writing]
+
+ROSALIND	Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.
+
+CELIA	[Reads]
+
+	Why should this a desert be?
+	For it is unpeopled? No:
+	Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
+	That shall civil sayings show:
+	Some, how brief the life of man
+	Runs his erring pilgrimage,
+	That the stretching of a span
+	Buckles in his sum of age;
+	Some, of violated vows
+	'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
+	But upon the fairest boughs,
+	Or at every sentence end,
+	Will I Rosalinda write,
+	Teaching all that read to know
+	The quintessence of every sprite
+	Heaven would in little show.
+	Therefore Heaven Nature charged
+	That one body should be fill'd
+	With all graces wide-enlarged:
+	Nature presently distill'd
+	Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
+	Cleopatra's majesty,
+	Atalanta's better part,
+	Sad Lucretia's modesty.
+	Thus Rosalind of many parts
+	By heavenly synod was devised,
+	Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
+	To have the touches dearest prized.
+	Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
+	And I to live and die her slave.
+
+ROSALIND	O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love
+	have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never
+	cried 'Have patience, good people!'
+
+CELIA	How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.
+	Go with him, sirrah.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
+	though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
+
+	[Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE]
+
+CELIA	Didst thou hear these verses?
+
+ROSALIND	O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of
+	them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
+
+CELIA	That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
+
+ROSALIND	Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
+	themselves without the verse and therefore stood
+	lamely in the verse.
+
+CELIA	But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
+	should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
+
+ROSALIND	I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
+	before you came; for look here what I found on a
+	palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
+	Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
+	can hardly remember.
+
+CELIA	Trow you who hath done this?
+
+ROSALIND	Is it a man?
+
+CELIA	And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
+	Change you colour?
+
+ROSALIND	I prithee, who?
+
+CELIA	O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to
+	meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
+	and so encounter.
+
+ROSALIND	Nay, but who is it?
+
+CELIA	Is it possible?
+
+ROSALIND	Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,
+	tell me who it is.
+
+CELIA	O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
+	wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
+	out of all hooping!
+
+ROSALIND	Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
+	caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
+	my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
+	South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
+	quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
+	stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
+	out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
+	mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
+	all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
+	may drink thy tidings.
+
+CELIA	So you may put a man in your belly.
+
+ROSALIND	Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
+	head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?
+
+CELIA	Nay, he hath but a little beard.
+
+ROSALIND	Why, God will send more, if the man will be
+	thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
+	thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
+
+CELIA	It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
+	heels and your heart both in an instant.
+
+ROSALIND	Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and
+	true maid.
+
+CELIA	I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
+
+ROSALIND	Orlando?
+
+CELIA	Orlando.
+
+ROSALIND	Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
+	hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
+	he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
+	him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
+	How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
+	him again? Answer me in one word.
+
+CELIA	You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
+	word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
+	say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
+	answer in a catechism.
+
+ROSALIND	But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
+	man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
+	day he wrestled?
+
+CELIA	It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
+	propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
+	finding him, and relish it with good observance.
+	I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
+
+ROSALIND	It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops
+	forth such fruit.
+
+CELIA	Give me audience, good madam.
+
+ROSALIND	Proceed.
+
+CELIA	There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.
+
+ROSALIND	Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
+	becomes the ground.
+
+CELIA	Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
+	unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
+
+ROSALIND	O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
+
+CELIA	I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
+	me out of tune.
+
+ROSALIND	Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must
+	speak. Sweet, say on.
+
+CELIA	You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
+
+	[Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES]
+
+ROSALIND	'Tis he: slink by, and note him.
+
+JAQUES	I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
+	as lief have been myself alone.
+
+ORLANDO	And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
+	too for your society.
+
+JAQUES	God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
+
+ORLANDO	I do desire we may be better strangers.
+
+JAQUES	I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
+	love-songs in their barks.
+
+ORLANDO	I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
+	them ill-favouredly.
+
+JAQUES	Rosalind is your love's name?
+
+ORLANDO	Yes, just.
+
+JAQUES	I do not like her name.
+
+ORLANDO	There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
+	christened.
+
+JAQUES	What stature is she of?
+
+ORLANDO	Just as high as my heart.
+
+JAQUES	You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
+	acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
+	out of rings?
+
+ORLANDO	Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
+	whence you have studied your questions.
+
+JAQUES	You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
+	Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
+	we two will rail against our mistress the world and
+	all our misery.
+
+ORLANDO	I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
+	against whom I know most faults.
+
+JAQUES	The worst fault you have is to be in love.
+
+ORLANDO	'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
+	I am weary of you.
+
+JAQUES	By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
+	you.
+
+ORLANDO	He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
+	shall see him.
+
+JAQUES	There I shall see mine own figure.
+
+ORLANDO	Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
+
+JAQUES	I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
+	Signior Love.
+
+ORLANDO	I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
+	Melancholy.
+
+	[Exit JAQUES]
+
+ROSALIND	[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucy
+	lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
+	Do you hear, forester?
+
+ORLANDO	Very well: what would you?
+
+ROSALIND	I pray you, what is't o'clock?
+
+ORLANDO	You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
+	in the forest.
+
+ROSALIND	Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
+	sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
+	detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
+
+ORLANDO	And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
+	been as proper?
+
+ROSALIND	By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
+	divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
+	withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
+	withal and who he stands still withal.
+
+ORLANDO	I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
+
+ROSALIND	Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
+	contract of her marriage and the day it is
+	solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
+	Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
+	seven year.
+
+ORLANDO	Who ambles Time withal?
+
+ROSALIND	With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
+	hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
+	he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
+	he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
+	and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
+	of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
+
+ORLANDO	Who doth he gallop withal?
+
+ROSALIND	With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
+	softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
+
+ORLANDO	Who stays it still withal?
+
+ROSALIND	With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
+	term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
+
+ORLANDO	Where dwell you, pretty youth?
+
+ROSALIND	With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
+	skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
+
+ORLANDO	Are you native of this place?
+
+ROSALIND	As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
+
+ORLANDO	Your accent is something finer than you could
+	purchase in so removed a dwelling.
+
+ROSALIND	I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
+	religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
+	in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
+	too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
+	him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
+	I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
+	giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
+	whole sex withal.
+
+ORLANDO	Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
+	laid to the charge of women?
+
+ROSALIND	There were none principal; they were all like one
+	another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
+	monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
+
+ORLANDO	I prithee, recount some of them.
+
+ROSALIND	No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
+	are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
+	abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
+	their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
+	on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
+	Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
+	give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
+	quotidian of love upon him.
+
+ORLANDO	I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
+	your remedy.
+
+ROSALIND	There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
+	taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
+	of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
+
+ORLANDO	What were his marks?
+
+ROSALIND	A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
+	sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
+	spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
+	which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
+	simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
+	revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
+	bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
+	untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
+	careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
+	are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
+	loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
+
+ORLANDO	Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
+
+ROSALIND	Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
+	love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
+	do than to confess she does: that is one of the
+	points in the which women still give the lie to
+	their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
+	that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
+	is so admired?
+
+ORLANDO	I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
+	Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
+
+ROSALIND	But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
+
+ORLANDO	Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
+
+ROSALIND	Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
+	as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
+	the reason why they are not so punished and cured
+	is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
+	are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
+
+ORLANDO	Did you ever cure any so?
+
+ROSALIND	Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
+	his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
+	woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
+	youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
+	and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
+	inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
+	passion something and for no passion truly any
+	thing, as boys and women are for the most part
+	cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
+	him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
+	for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
+	from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
+	madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
+	the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
+	And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
+	me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
+	heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
+
+ORLANDO	I would not be cured, youth.
+
+ROSALIND	I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
+	and come every day to my cote and woo me.
+
+ORLANDO	Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
+	where it is.
+
+ROSALIND	Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
+	you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
+	Will you go?
+
+ORLANDO	With all my heart, good youth.
+
+ROSALIND	Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?
+

+ACT III
+
+
+
+SCENE III	The forest.
+
+
+	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind]
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
+	goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
+	doth my simple feature content you?
+
+AUDREY	Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!
+
+TOUCHSTONE	I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
+	capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
+
+JAQUES	[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
+	in a thatched house!
+
+TOUCHSTONE	When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
+	man's good wit seconded with the forward child
+	Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
+	great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
+	the gods had made thee poetical.
+
+AUDREY	I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
+	deed and word? is it a true thing?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
+	feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
+	they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
+
+AUDREY	Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
+	honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
+	hope thou didst feign.
+
+AUDREY	Would you not have me honest?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
+	honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
+
+JAQUES	[Aside]  A material fool!
+
+AUDREY	 Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
+	make me honest.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
+	were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
+
+AUDREY	I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
+	sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
+	be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
+	with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
+	village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
+	of the forest and to couple us.
+
+JAQUES	[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.
+
+AUDREY	Well, the gods give us joy!
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
+	stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
+	but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
+	though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are
+	necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
+	his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
+	knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
+	his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
+	Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
+	hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
+	therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
+	worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
+	married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
+	bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
+	skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
+	want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
+
+	[Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT]
+
+	Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
+	dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
+	with you to your chapel?
+
+SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Is there none here to give the woman?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	I will not take her on gift of any man.
+
+SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
+
+JAQUES	[Advancing]
+
+	Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
+	sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
+	last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
+	toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.
+
+JAQUES	Will you be married, motley?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
+	the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
+	as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
+
+JAQUES	And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
+	married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
+	church, and have a good priest that can tell you
+	what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
+	together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
+	prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be
+	married of him than of another: for he is not like
+	to marry me well; and not being well married, it
+	will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
+
+JAQUES	Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	'Come, sweet Audrey:
+	We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
+	Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
+	O sweet Oliver,
+	O brave Oliver,
+	Leave me not behind thee: but,--
+	Wind away,
+	Begone, I say,
+	I will not to wedding with thee.
+
+	[Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]
+
+SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
+	all shall flout me out of my calling.

+ACT III
+
+
+
+SCENE IV	The forest.
+
+
+	[Enter ROSALIND and CELIA]
+
+ROSALIND	Never talk to me; I will weep.
+
+CELIA	Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
+	that tears do not become a man.
+
+ROSALIND	But have I not cause to weep?
+
+CELIA	As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
+
+ROSALIND	His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
+
+CELIA	Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
+	Judas's own children.
+
+ROSALIND	I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
+
+CELIA	An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
+
+ROSALIND	And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
+	of holy bread.
+
+CELIA	He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
+	of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
+	the very ice of chastity is in them.
+
+ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
+	comes not?
+
+CELIA	Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
+
+ROSALIND	Do you think so?
+
+CELIA	Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
+	horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
+	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
+	worm-eaten nut.
+
+ROSALIND	Not true in love?
+
+CELIA	Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
+
+ROSALIND	You have heard him swear downright he was.
+
+CELIA	'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
+	no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
+	both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
+	here in the forest on the duke your father.
+
+ROSALIND	I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
+	him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
+	him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
+	But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
+	man as Orlando?
+
+CELIA	O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
+	speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
+	them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
+	his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
+	but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
+	goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
+	guides. Who comes here?
+
+	[Enter CORIN]
+
+CORIN	Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
+	After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
+	Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
+	Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
+	That was his mistress.
+
+CELIA	Well, and what of him?
+
+CORIN	If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
+	Between the pale complexion of true love
+	And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
+	Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
+	If you will mark it.
+
+ROSALIND	O, come, let us remove:
+	The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
+	Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
+	I'll prove a busy actor in their play.

+ACT III
+
+
+
+SCENE V	Another part of the forest.
+
+
+	[Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]
+
+SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;
+	Say that you love me not, but say not so
+	In bitterness. The common executioner,
+	Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
+	Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
+	But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
+	Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
+
+	[Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind]
+
+PHEBE	I would not be thy executioner:
+	I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
+	Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
+	'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
+	That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
+	Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
+	Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
+	Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
+	And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
+	Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
+	Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
+	Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
+	Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
+	Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
+	Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
+	The cicatrice and capable impressure
+	Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
+	Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
+	Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
+	That can do hurt.
+
+SILVIUS	                  O dear Phebe,
+	If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
+	You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
+	Then shall you know the wounds invisible
+	That love's keen arrows make.
+
+PHEBE	But till that time
+	Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
+	Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
+	As till that time I shall not pity thee.
+
+ROSALIND	And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
+	That you insult, exult, and all at once,
+	Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
+	As, by my faith, I see no more in you
+	Than without candle may go dark to bed--
+	Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
+	Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
+	I see no more in you than in the ordinary
+	Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
+	I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
+	No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
+	'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
+	Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
+	That can entame my spirits to your worship.
+	You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
+	Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
+	You are a thousand times a properer man
+	Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
+	That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
+	'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
+	And out of you she sees herself more proper
+	Than any of her lineaments can show her.
+	But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
+	And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
+	For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
+	Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
+	Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
+	Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
+	So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.
+
+PHEBE	Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
+	I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
+
+ROSALIND	He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
+	fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
+	she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
+	with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
+
+PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you.
+
+ROSALIND	I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
+	For I am falser than vows made in wine:
+	Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
+	'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
+	Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
+	Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
+	And be not proud: though all the world could see,
+	None could be so abused in sight as he.
+	Come, to our flock.
+
+	[Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN]
+
+PHEBE	Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
+	'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'
+
+SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe,--
+
+PHEBE	                  Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?
+
+SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, pity me.
+
+PHEBE	Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
+
+SILVIUS	Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:
+	If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
+	By giving love your sorrow and my grief
+	Were both extermined.
+
+PHEBE	Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?
+
+SILVIUS	I would have you.
+
+PHEBE	                  Why, that were covetousness.
+	Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
+	And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
+	But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
+	Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
+	I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
+	But do not look for further recompense
+	Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
+
+SILVIUS	So holy and so perfect is my love,
+	And I in such a poverty of grace,
+	That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
+	To glean the broken ears after the man
+	That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
+	A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.
+
+PHEBE	Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
+
+SILVIUS	Not very well, but I have met him oft;
+	And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
+	That the old carlot once was master of.
+
+PHEBE	Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
+	'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
+	But what care I for words? yet words do well
+	When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
+	It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
+	But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
+	He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
+	Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
+	Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
+	He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
+	His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
+	There was a pretty redness in his lip,
+	A little riper and more lusty red
+	Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
+	Between the constant red and mingled damask.
+	There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
+	In parcels as I did, would have gone near
+	To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
+	I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
+	I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
+	For what had he to do to chide at me?
+	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
+	And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:
+	I marvel why I answer'd not again:
+	But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
+	I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
+	And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?
+
+SILVIUS	Phebe, with all my heart.
+
+PHEBE	I'll write it straight;
+	The matter's in my head and in my heart:
+	I will be bitter with him and passing short.
+	Go with me, Silvius.

+ACT IV
+
+
+
+SCENE I	The forest.
+
+
+	[Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES]
+
+JAQUES	I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
+	with thee.
+
+ROSALIND	They say you are a melancholy fellow.
+
+JAQUES	I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
+
+ROSALIND	Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
+	fellows and betray themselves to every modern
+	censure worse than drunkards.
+
+JAQUES	Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
+
+ROSALIND	Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
+
+JAQUES	I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
+	emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
+	nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
+	soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
+	which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
+	the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
+	melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
+	extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
+	contemplation of my travels, in which my often
+	rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.
+
+ROSALIND	A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
+	be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
+	other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
+	nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
+
+JAQUES	Yes, I have gained my experience.
+
+ROSALIND	And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
+	a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
+	sad; and to travel for it too!
+
+	[Enter ORLANDO]
+
+ORLANDO	Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
+
+JAQUES	Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.
+
+	[Exit]
+
+ROSALIND	Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
+	wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
+	own country, be out of love with your nativity and
+	almost chide God for making you that countenance you
+	are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
+	gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
+	all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
+	another trick, never come in my sight more.
+
+ORLANDO	My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
+
+ROSALIND	Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
+	divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
+	a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
+	affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
+	hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
+	him heart-whole.
+
+ORLANDO	Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
+
+ROSALIND	Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
+	had as lief be wooed of a snail.
+
+ORLANDO	Of a snail?
+
+ROSALIND	Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
+	carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
+	I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
+	his destiny with him.
+
+ORLANDO	What's that?
+
+ROSALIND	Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
+	beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
+	his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
+
+ORLANDO	Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
+
+ROSALIND	And I am your Rosalind.
+
+CELIA	It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
+	Rosalind of a better leer than you.
+
+ROSALIND	Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
+	humour and like enough to consent. What would you
+	say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?
+
+ORLANDO	I would kiss before I spoke.
+
+ROSALIND	Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
+	gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
+	occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
+	out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
+	warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
+
+ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied?
+
+ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
+
+ORLANDO	Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
+
+ROSALIND	Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
+	I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
+
+ORLANDO	What, of my suit?
+
+ROSALIND	Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
+	Am not I your Rosalind?
+
+ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
+	talking of her.
+
+ROSALIND	Well in her person I say I will not have you.
+
+ORLANDO	Then in mine own person I die.
+
+ROSALIND	No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
+	almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
+	there was not any man died in his own person,
+	videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
+	dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
+	could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
+	of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
+	year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
+	for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
+	but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
+	taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
+	coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
+	But these are all lies: men have died from time to
+	time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
+
+ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
+	for, I protest, her frown might kill me.
+
+ROSALIND	By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
+	I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
+	disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
+	it.
+
+ORLANDO	Then love me, Rosalind.
+
+ROSALIND	Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
+
+ORLANDO	And wilt thou have me?
+
+ROSALIND	Ay, and twenty such.
+
+ORLANDO	What sayest thou?
+
+ROSALIND	Are you not good?
+
+ORLANDO	I hope so.
+
+ROSALIND	Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
+	Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
+	Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?
+
+ORLANDO	Pray thee, marry us.
+
+CELIA	I cannot say the words.
+
+ROSALIND	You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'
+
+CELIA	Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
+
+ORLANDO	I will.
+
+ROSALIND	Ay, but when?
+
+ORLANDO	Why now; as fast as she can marry us.
+
+ROSALIND	Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
+
+ORLANDO	I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
+
+ROSALIND	I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
+	thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
+	before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
+	runs before her actions.
+
+ORLANDO	So do all thoughts; they are winged.
+
+ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you
+	have possessed her.
+
+ORLANDO	For ever and a day.
+
+ROSALIND	Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
+	men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
+	maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
+	changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
+	of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
+	more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
+	new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
+	than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
+	in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
+	disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
+	that when thou art inclined to sleep.
+
+ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?
+
+ROSALIND	By my life, she will do as I do.
+
+ORLANDO	O, but she is wise.
+
+ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
+	wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
+	wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
+	'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
+	with the smoke out at the chimney.
+
+ORLANDO	A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
+	'Wit, whither wilt?'
+
+ROSALIND	Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
+	your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
+
+ORLANDO	And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
+
+ROSALIND	Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
+	never take her without her answer, unless you take
+	her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
+	make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
+	never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
+	it like a fool!
+
+ORLANDO	For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
+
+ROSALIND	Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
+
+ORLANDO	I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
+	will be with thee again.
+
+ROSALIND	Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
+	would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
+	thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
+	won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
+	death! Two o'clock is your hour?
+
+ORLANDO	Ay, sweet Rosalind.
+
+ROSALIND	By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
+	me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
+	if you break one jot of your promise or come one
+	minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
+	pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
+	and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
+	may be chosen out of the gross band of the
+	unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
+	your promise.
+
+ORLANDO	With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
+	Rosalind: so adieu.
+
+ROSALIND	Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
+	offenders, and let Time try: adieu.
+
+	[Exit ORLANDO]
+
+CELIA	You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
+	we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
+	head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
+	her own nest.
+
+ROSALIND	O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
+	didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
+	it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
+	bottom, like the bay of Portugal.
+
+CELIA	Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
+	affection in, it runs out.
+
+ROSALIND	No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
+	of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
+	that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
+	because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
+	am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
+	of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
+	sigh till he come.
+
+CELIA	And I'll sleep.

+JAQUES	Which is he that killed the deer?
+
+A Lord	Sir, it was I.
+
+JAQUES	Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
+	conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
+	horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
+	you no song, forester, for this purpose?
+
+Forester	Yes, sir.
+
+JAQUES	Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it

+	
+	SONG.
+Forester	What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
+	His leather skin and horns to wear.
+	Then sing him home;

+
+	Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;

+	[Enter ROSALIND and CELIA]
+
+ROSALIND	How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
+	here much Orlando!
+
+CELIA	I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
+	hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
+	sleep. Look, who comes here.
+
+	[Enter SILVIUS]
+
+SILVIUS	My errand is to you, fair youth;
+	My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
+	I know not the contents; but, as I guess
+	By the stern brow and waspish action
+	Which she did use as she was writing of it,
+	It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
+	I am but as a guiltless messenger.
+
+ROSALIND	Patience herself would startle at this letter
+	And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
+	She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
+	She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
+	Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
+	Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
+	Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
+	This is a letter of your own device.
+
+SILVIUS	No, I protest, I know not the contents:
+	Phebe did write it.
+
+ROSALIND	Come, come, you are a fool
+	And turn'd into the extremity of love.
+	I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
+	A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
+	That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
+	She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
+	I say she never did invent this letter;
+	This is a man's invention and his hand.
+
+SILVIUS	Sure, it is hers.
+
+ROSALIND	Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
+	A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
+	Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
+	Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
+	Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
+	Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
+
+SILVIUS	So please you, for I never heard it yet;
+	Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
+
+ROSALIND	She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
+
+	[Reads]
+
+	Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
+	That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
+	Can a woman rail thus?
+
+SILVIUS	Call you this railing?
+
+ROSALIND	[Reads]
+
+	Why, thy godhead laid apart,
+	Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
+	Did you ever hear such railing?
+	Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
+	That could do no vengeance to me.
+	Meaning me a beast.
+	If the scorn of your bright eyne
+	Have power to raise such love in mine,
+	Alack, in me what strange effect
+	Would they work in mild aspect!
+	Whiles you chid me, I did love;
+	How then might your prayers move!
+	He that brings this love to thee
+	Little knows this love in me:
+	And by him seal up thy mind;
+	Whether that thy youth and kind
+	Will the faithful offer take
+	Of me and all that I can make;
+	Or else by him my love deny,
+	And then I'll study how to die.
+
+SILVIUS	Call you this chiding?
+
+CELIA	Alas, poor shepherd!
+
+ROSALIND	Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt
+	thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
+	instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
+	be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
+	love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
+	her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
+	thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
+	thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
+	hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

+
+OLIVER	Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,

+CELIA	West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:
+	The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
+	Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
+	But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
+	There's none within.
+
+OLIVER	If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
+	Then should I know you by description;
+	Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
+	Of female favour, and bestows himself
+	Like a ripe sister: the woman low
+	And browner than her brother.' Are not you
+	The owner of the house I did inquire for?
+
+CELIA	It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
+
+OLIVER	Orlando doth commend him to you both,
+	And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
+	He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
+
+ROSALIND	I am: what must we understand by this?
+
+OLIVER	Some of my shame; if you will know of me
+	What man I am, and how, and why, and where
+	This handkercher was stain'd.
+
+CELIA	I pray you, tell it.
+
+OLIVER	When last the young Orlando parted from you
+	He left a promise to return again
+	Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
+	Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
+	Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
+	And mark what object did present itself:
+	Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
+	And high top bald with dry antiquity,
+	A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
+	Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
+	A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
+	Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
+	The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
+	Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
+	And with indented glides did slip away
+	Into a bush: under which bush's shade
+	A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
+	Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
+	When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
+	The royal disposition of that beast
+	To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
+	This seen, Orlando did approach the man
+	And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
+
+CELIA	O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
+	And he did render him the most unnatural
+	That lived amongst men.
+
+OLIVER	And well he might so do,
+	For well I know he was unnatural.
+
+ROSALIND	But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
+	Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
+
+OLIVER	Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
+	But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
+	And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
+	Made him give battle to the lioness,
+	Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
+	From miserable slumber I awaked.
+
+CELIA	Are you his brother?
+
+ROSALIND	Wast you he rescued?
+
+CELIA	Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
+
+OLIVER	'Twas I; but 'tis not I	I do not shame
+	To tell you what I was, since my conversion
+	So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
+
+ROSALIND	But, for the bloody napkin?
+
+OLIVER	By and by.
+	When from the first to last betwixt us two
+	Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
+	As how I came into that desert place:--
+	In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
+	Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
+	Committing me unto my brother's love;
+	Who led me instantly unto his cave,
+	There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
+	The lioness had torn some flesh away,
+	Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
+	And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
+	Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
+	And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
+	He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
+	To tell this story, that you might excuse
+	His broken promise, and to give this napkin
+	Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
+	That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
+
+	[ROSALIND swoons]
+
+CELIA	Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
+
+OLIVER	Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
+
+CELIA	There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
+
+OLIVER	Look, he recovers.
+
+ROSALIND	I would I were at home.
+
+CELIA	We'll lead you thither.
+	I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
+
+OLIVER	Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a
+	man's heart.
+
+ROSALIND	I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would
+	think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell
+	your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
+
+OLIVER	This was not counterfeit: there is too great
+	testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
+	of earnest.
+
+ROSALIND	Counterfeit, I assure you.
+
+OLIVER	Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
+
+ROSALIND	So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.
+
+CELIA	Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw
+	homewards. Good sir, go with us.
+
+OLIVER	That will I, for I must bear answer back
+	How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
+
+ROSALIND	I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend
+	my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?

+
+TOUCHSTONE	A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile

+
+AUDREY	Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in

+
+WILLIAM	Five and twenty, sir.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	A ripe age. Is thy name William?
+
+WILLIAM	William, sir.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?

+WILLIAM	Ay, sir, I thank God.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?
+
+WILLIAM	Faith, sir, so so.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
+	yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
+
+WILLIAM	Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,
+	'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
+	knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen
+	philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
+	would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;
+	meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
+	lips to open. You do love this maid?
+
+WILLIAM	I do, sir.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
+
+WILLIAM	No, sir.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it
+	is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out
+	of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty

+	is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
+
+WILLIAM	Which he, sir?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
+	clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the
+	society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this
+	female,--which in the common is woman; which
+	together is, abandon the society of this female, or,
+	clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better
+	understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make
+	thee away, translate thy life into death, thy
+	liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with
+	thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy
+	with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with
+	policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:

+
+ORLANDO	Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you

+	grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?
+
+OLIVER	Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the
+	poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden
+	wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,
+	I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;
+	consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
+	shall be to your good; for my father's house and all
+	the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I
+	estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
+
+ORLANDO	You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:
+	thither will I invite the duke and all's contented
+	followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look
+	you, here comes my Rosalind.
+
+	[Enter ROSALIND]
+
+ROSALIND	God save you, brother.
+
+OLIVER	And you, fair sister.
+
+	[Exit]
+
+ROSALIND	O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee
+	wear thy heart in a scarf!
+
+ORLANDO	It is my arm.
+
+ROSALIND	I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
+	of a lion.
+
+ORLANDO	Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
+
+ROSALIND	Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
+	swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?
+
+ORLANDO	Ay, and greater wonders than that.
+
+ROSALIND	O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was
+	never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
+	and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and
+	overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
+	met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
+	loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
+	sighed but they asked one another the reason, no
+	sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;
+	and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
+	to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
+	else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
+	the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs
+	cannot part them.
+
+ORLANDO	They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the
+	duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it
+	is to look into happiness through another man's
+	eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
+	the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
+	think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
+
+ROSALIND	Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
+
+ORLANDO	I can live no longer by thinking.
+
+ROSALIND	I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
+	Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
+	that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
+	speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
+	of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;
+	neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
+	some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
+	yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
+	you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
+	since I was three year old, conversed with a
+	magician, most profound in his art and yet not
+	damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
+	as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
+	marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
+	what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
+	not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
+	to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
+	as she is and without any danger.
+
+ORLANDO	Speakest thou in sober meanings?
+
+ROSALIND	By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I
+	say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your
+	best array: bid your friends; for if you will be
+	married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.
+
+	[Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]
+
+	Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.
+
+PHEBE	Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
+	To show the letter that I writ to you.
+
+ROSALIND	I care not if I have: it is my study
+	To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
+	You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
+	Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
+
+PHEBE	Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
+
+SILVIUS	It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
+	And so am I for Phebe.
+
+PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.
+
+ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.

+PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.
+
+ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.
+
+ROSALIND	And I for no woman.
+
+SILVIUS	It is to be all made of fantasy,
+	All made of passion and all made of wishes,
+	All adoration, duty, and observance,
+	All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
+	All purity, all trial, all observance;
+	And so am I for Phebe.
+
+PHEBE	And so am I for Ganymede.
+
+ORLANDO	And so am I for Rosalind.
+
+ROSALIND	And so am I for no woman.
+
+PHEBE	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
+
+SILVIUS	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
+
+ORLANDO	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
+
+ROSALIND	Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
+
+ORLANDO	To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
+
+ROSALIND	Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling
+	of Irish wolves against the moon.
+
+	[To SILVIUS]
+
+	I will help you, if I can:
+
+	[To PHEBE]
+
+	I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.

+
+	I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
+	shall be married to-morrow:
+
+	[To SILVIUS]
+
+	I will content you, if what pleases you contents
+	you, and you shall be married to-morrow.
+

+

+

+AUDREY	I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is

+
+	[Enter two Pages]
+
+First Page	Well met, honest gentleman.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.
+
+Second Page	We are for you: sit i' the middle.
+
+First Page	Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or
+	spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only
+	prologues to a bad voice?
+
+Second Page	I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two
+	gipsies on a horse.
+	
+	SONG.
+	It was a lover and his lass,
+	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
+	That o'er the green corn-field did pass
+	In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
+	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:
+	Sweet lovers love the spring.
+
+	Between the acres of the rye,
+	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino
+	These pretty country folks would lie,
+	In spring time, &c.
+
+	This carol they began that hour,
+	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
+	How that a life was but a flower
+	In spring time, &c.
+
+	And therefore take the present time,
+	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;
+	For love is crowned with the prime
+	In spring time, &c.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
+	matter in the ditty, yet the note was very
+	untuneable.
+
+First Page	You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.

+
+	[Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE]
+
+ROSALIND	Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:
+	You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
+	You will bestow her on Orlando here?
+
+DUKE SENIOR	That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
+
+ROSALIND	And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?
+
+ORLANDO	That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
+
+ROSALIND	You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?
+
+PHEBE	That will I, should I die the hour after.
+
+ROSALIND	But if you do refuse to marry me,
+	You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
+
+PHEBE	So is the bargain.
+
+ROSALIND	You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
+
+SILVIUS	Though to have her and death were both one thing.
+
+ROSALIND	I have promised to make all this matter even.
+	Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
+	You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
+	Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
+	Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
+	Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.

+
+DUKE SENIOR	I do remember in this shepherd boy
+	Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
+
+ORLANDO	My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
+	Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
+	But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
+	And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
+	Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
+	Whom he reports to be a great magician,
+	Obscured in the circle of this forest.
+
+	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]
+
+JAQUES	There is, sure, another flood toward, and these
+	couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
+	very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Salutation and greeting to you all!
+
+JAQUES	Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
+	motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
+	the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
+	purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
+	a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
+	with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
+	had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
+
+JAQUES	And how was that ta'en up?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
+	seventh cause.
+
+JAQUES	How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	I like him very well.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I
+	press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
+	copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
+	marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
+	sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
+	humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
+	will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
+	poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
+
+TOUCHSTONE	According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
+
+JAQUES	But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
+	quarrel on the seventh cause?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
+	seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
+	cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
+	if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
+	mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
+	If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
+	would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
+	this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
+	not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
+	called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
+	well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
+	is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
+	well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
+	Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
+	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
+
+JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
+	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
+	measured swords and parted.
+
+JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
+
+TOUCHSTONE	O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
+	books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
+	The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
+	Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
+	fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
+	Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
+	Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
+	these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
+	avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
+	justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
+	parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
+	of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
+	they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
+	only peacemaker; much virtue in If.
+
+JAQUES	Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
+	any thing and yet a fool.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
+	the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

+PHEBE	I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
+	Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
+
+	[Enter JAQUES DE BOYS]
+
+JAQUES DE BOYS	Let me have audience for a word or two:
+	I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
+	That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
+	Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
+	Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
+	Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
+	In his own conduct, purposely to take
+	His brother here and put him to the sword:
+	And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
+	Where meeting with an old religious man,
+	After some question with him, was converted
+	Both from his enterprise and from the world,
+	His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
+	And all their lands restored to them again
+	That were with him exiled. This to be true,
+	I do engage my life.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Welcome, young man;
+	Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
+	To one his lands withheld, and to the other
+	A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
+	First, in this forest, let us do those ends
+	That here were well begun and well begot:
+	And after, every of this happy number
+	That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
+	Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
+	According to the measure of their states.
+	Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
+	And fall into our rustic revelry.
+	Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
+	With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.
+
+JAQUES	Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
+	The duke hath put on a religious life
+	And thrown into neglect the pompous court?
+
+JAQUES DE BOYS	He hath.
+
+JAQUES	To him will I : out of these convertites
+	There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
+
+	[To DUKE SENIOR]
+
+	You to your former honour I bequeath;
+	Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:
+
+	[To ORLANDO]
+
+	You to a love that your true faith doth merit:
+
+	[To OLIVER]
+
+	You to your land and love and great allies:
+
+	[To SILVIUS]
+
+	You to a long and well-deserved bed:
+
+	[To TOUCHSTONE]
+
+	And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
+	Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:
+	I am for other than for dancing measures.
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Stay, Jaques, stay.
+
+JAQUES	To see no pastime I	what you would have
+	I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.
+
+	[Exit]
+
+DUKE SENIOR	Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
+	As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.
+
+	[A dance]
+
+
+
+
+	AS YOU LIKE IT
+
+	EPILOGUE
+
+
+ROSALIND	It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;
+	but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
+	the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
+	no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no
+	epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
+	and good plays prove the better by the help of good
+	epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
+	neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
+	you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
+	furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
+	become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin
+	with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
+	you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
+	please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
+	you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,
+	none of you hates them--that between you and the
+	women the play may please. If I were a woman I
+	would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
+	me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
+	defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
+	beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
+	kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
+
+	[Exeunt]

+                              INTRODUCTION
+
+The Workshop on Electronic Texts (1) drew together representatives of
+various projects and interest groups to compare ideas, beliefs,
+experiences, and, in particular, methods of placing and presenting
+historical textual materials in computerized form.  Most attendees gained
+much in insight and outlook from the event.  But the assembly did not
+form a new nation, or, to put it another way, the diversity of projects
+and interests was too great to draw the representatives into a cohesive,
+action-oriented body.(2)
+
+Everyone attending the Workshop shared an interest in preserving and
+providing access to historical texts.  But within this broad field the
+attendees represented a variety of formal, informal, figurative, and
+literal groups, with many individuals belonging to more than one.  These
+groups may be defined roughly according to the following topics or
+activities:
+
+* Imaging
+* Searchable coded texts
+* National and international computer networks
+* CD-ROM production and dissemination
+* Methods and technology for converting older paper materials into
+electronic form
+* Study of the use of digital materials by scholars and others
+
+This summary is arranged thematically and does not follow the actual
+sequence of presentations.
+
+NOTES:
+     (1)  In this document, the phrase electronic text is used to mean
+     any computerized reproduction or version of a document, book,
+     article, or manuscript (including images), and not merely a machine-
+     readable or machine-searchable text.
+
+     (2)  The Workshop was held at the Library of Congress on 9-10 June
+     1992, with funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. 
+     The document that follows represents a summary of the presentations
+     made at the Workshop and was compiled by James DALY.  This
+     introduction was written by DALY and Carl FLEISCHHAUER.
+
+
+PRESERVATION AND IMAGING
+
+Preservation, as that term is used by archivists,(3) was most explicitly
+discussed in the context of imaging.  Anne KENNEY and Lynne PERSONIUS
+explained how the concept of a faithful copy and the user-friendliness of
+the traditional book have guided their project at Cornell University.(4) 
+Although interested in computerized dissemination, participants in the
+Cornell project are creating digital image sets of older books in the
+public domain as a source for a fresh paper facsimile or, in a future
+phase, microfilm.  The books returned to the library shelves are
+high-quality and useful replacements on acid-free paper that should last
+a long time.  To date, the Cornell project has placed little or no
+emphasis on creating searchable texts; one would not be surprised to find
+that the project participants view such texts as new editions, and thus
+not as faithful reproductions. 
+
+In her talk on preservation, Patricia BATTIN struck an ecumenical and
+flexible note as she endorsed the creation and dissemination of a variety
+of types of digital copies.  Do not be too narrow in defining what counts
+as a preservation element, BATTIN counseled; for the present, at least,
+digital copies made with preservation in mind cannot be as narrowly
+standardized as, say, microfilm copies with the same objective.  Setting
+standards precipitously can inhibit creativity, but delay can result in
+chaos, she advised.
+
+In part, BATTIN's position reflected the unsettled nature of image-format
+standards, and attendees could hear echoes of this unsettledness in the
+comments of various speakers.  For example, Jean BARONAS reviewed the
+status of several formal standards moving through committees of experts;
+and Clifford LYNCH encouraged the use of a new guideline for transmitting
+document images on Internet.  Testimony from participants in the National
+Agricultural Library's (NAL) Text Digitization Program and LC's American
+Memory project highlighted some of the challenges to the actual creation
+or interchange of images, including difficulties in converting
+preservation microfilm to digital form.  Donald WATERS reported on the
+progress of a master plan for a project at Yale University to convert
+books on microfilm to digital image sets, Project Open Book (POB).
+
+The Workshop offered rather less of an imaging practicum than planned,
+but "how-to" hints emerge at various points, for example, throughout
+KENNEY's presentation and in the discussion of arcana such as
+thresholding and dithering offered by George THOMA and FLEISCHHAUER.
+
+NOTES:
+     (3)  Although there is a sense in which any reproductions of
+     historical materials preserve the human record, specialists in the
+     field have developed particular guidelines for the creation of
+     acceptable preservation copies.
+
+     (4)  Titles and affiliations of presenters are given at the
+     beginning of their respective talks and in the Directory of
+     Participants (Appendix III).
+
+
+THE MACHINE-READABLE TEXT:  MARKUP AND USE
+
+The sections of the Workshop that dealt with machine-readable text tended
+to be more concerned with access and use than with preservation, at least
+in the narrow technical sense.  Michael SPERBERG-McQUEEN made a forceful
+presentation on the Text Encoding Initiative's (TEI) implementation of
+the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).  His ideas were echoed
+by Susan HOCKEY, Elli MYLONAS, and Stuart WEIBEL.  While the
+presentations made by the TEI advocates contained no practicum, their
+discussion focused on the value of the finished product, what the
+European Community calls reusability, but what may also be termed
+durability.  They argued that marking up--that is, coding--a text in a
+well-conceived way will permit it to be moved from one computer
+environment to another, as well as to be used by various users.  Two
+kinds of markup were distinguished:  1) procedural markup, which
+describes the features of a text (e.g., dots on a page), and 2)
+descriptive markup, which describes the structure or elements of a
+document (e.g., chapters, paragraphs, and front matter).
+
+The TEI proponents emphasized the importance of texts to scholarship. 
+They explained how heavily coded (and thus analyzed and annotated) texts
+can underlie research, play a role in scholarly communication, and
+facilitate classroom teaching.  SPERBERG-McQUEEN reminded listeners that
+a written or printed item (e.g., a particular edition of a book) is
+merely a representation of the abstraction we call a text.  To concern
+ourselves with faithfully reproducing a printed instance of the text,
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN argued, is to concern ourselves with the representation
+of a representation ("images as simulacra for the text").  The TEI proponents'
+interest in images tends to focus on corollary materials for use in teaching,
+for example, photographs of the Acropolis to accompany a Greek text.
+
+By the end of the Workshop, SPERBERG-McQUEEN confessed to having been
+converted to a limited extent to the view that electronic images
+constitute a promising alternative to microfilming; indeed, an
+alternative probably superior to microfilming.  But he was not convinced
+that electronic images constitute a serious attempt to represent text in
+electronic form.  HOCKEY and MYLONAS also conceded that their experience
+at the Pierce Symposium the previous week at Georgetown University and
+the present conference at the Library of Congress had compelled them to
+reevaluate their perspective on the usefulness of text as images. 
+Attendees could see that the text and image advocates were in
+constructive tension, so to say.
+
+Three nonTEI presentations described approaches to preparing
+machine-readable text that are less rigorous and thus less expensive.  In
+the case of the Papers of George Washington, Dorothy TWOHIG explained
+that the digital version will provide a not-quite-perfect rendering of
+the transcribed text--some 135,000 documents, available for research
+during the decades while the perfect or print version is completed. 
+Members of the American Memory team and the staff of NAL's Text
+Digitization Program (see below) also outlined a middle ground concerning
+searchable texts.  In the case of American Memory, contractors produce
+texts with about 99-percent accuracy that serve as "browse" or
+"reference" versions of written or printed originals.  End users who need
+faithful copies or perfect renditions must refer to accompanying sets of
+digital facsimile images or consult copies of the originals in a nearby
+library or archive.  American Memory staff argued that the high cost of
+producing 100-percent accurate copies would prevent LC from offering
+access to large parts of its collections.
+
+
+THE MACHINE-READABLE TEXT:  METHODS OF CONVERSION
+
+Although the Workshop did not include a systematic examination of the
+methods for converting texts from paper (or from facsimile images) into
+machine-readable form, nevertheless, various speakers touched upon this
+matter.  For example, WEIBEL reported that OCLC has experimented with a
+merging of multiple optical character recognition systems that will
+reduce errors from an unacceptable rate of 5 characters out of every
+l,000 to an unacceptable rate of 2 characters out of every l,000.
+
+Pamela ANDRE presented an overview of NAL's Text Digitization Program and
+Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details.  ZIDAR explained how NAL
+purchased hardware and software capable of performing optical character
+recognition (OCR) and text conversion and used its own staff to convert
+texts.  The process, ZIDAR said, required extensive editing and project
+staff found themselves considering alternatives, including rekeying
+and/or creating abstracts or summaries of texts.  NAL reckoned costs at
+$7 per page.  By way of contrast, Ricky ERWAY explained that American
+Memory had decided from the start to contract out conversion to external
+service bureaus.  The criteria used to select these contractors were cost
+and quality of results, as opposed to methods of conversion.  ERWAY noted
+that historical documents or books often do not lend themselves to OCR. 
+Bound materials represent a special problem.  In her experience, quality
+control--inspecting incoming materials, counting errors in samples--posed
+the most time-consuming aspect of contracting out conversion.  ERWAY
+reckoned American Memory's costs at $4 per page, but cautioned that fewer
+cost-elements had been included than in NAL's figure.
+
+
+OPTIONS FOR DISSEMINATION
+
+The topic of dissemination proper emerged at various points during the
+Workshop.  At the session devoted to national and international computer
+networks, LYNCH, Howard BESSER, Ronald LARSEN, and Edwin BROWNRIGG
+highlighted the virtues of Internet today and of the network that will
+evolve from Internet.  Listeners could discern in these narratives a
+vision of an information democracy in which millions of citizens freely
+find and use what they need.  LYNCH noted that a lack of standards
+inhibits disseminating multimedia on the network, a topic also discussed
+by BESSER.  LARSEN addressed the issues of network scalability and
+modularity and commented upon the difficulty of anticipating the effects
+of growth in orders of magnitude.  BROWNRIGG talked about the ability of
+packet radio to provide certain links in a network without the need for
+wiring.  However, the presenters also called attention to the
+shortcomings and incongruities of present-day computer networks.  For
+example:  1) Network use is growing dramatically, but much network
+traffic consists of personal communication (E-mail).  2) Large bodies of
+information are available, but a user's ability to search across their
+entirety is limited.  3) There are significant resources for science and
+technology, but few network sources provide content in the humanities. 
+4) Machine-readable texts are commonplace, but the capability of the
+system to deal with images (let alone other media formats) lags behind. 
+A glimpse of a multimedia future for networks, however, was provided by
+Maria LEBRON in her overview of the Online Journal of Current Clinical
+Trials (OJCCT), and the process of scholarly publishing on-line.   
+
+The contrasting form of the CD-ROM disk was never systematically
+analyzed, but attendees could glean an impression from several of the
+show-and-tell presentations.  The Perseus and American Memory examples
+demonstrated recently published disks, while the descriptions of the
+IBYCUS version of the Papers of George Washington and Chadwyck-Healey's
+Patrologia Latina Database (PLD) told of disks to come.  According to
+Eric CALALUCA, PLD's principal focus has been on converting Jacques-Paul
+Migne's definitive collection of Latin texts to machine-readable form. 
+Although everyone could share the network advocates' enthusiasm for an
+on-line future, the possibility of rolling up one's sleeves for a session
+with a CD-ROM containing both textual materials and a powerful retrieval
+engine made the disk seem an appealing vessel indeed.  The overall
+discussion suggested that the transition from CD-ROM to on-line networked
+access may prove far slower and more difficult than has been anticipated.
+
+
+WHO ARE THE USERS AND WHAT DO THEY DO?
+
+Although concerned with the technicalities of production, the Workshop
+never lost sight of the purposes and uses of electronic versions of
+textual materials.  As noted above, those interested in imaging discussed
+the problematical matter of digital preservation, while the TEI proponents
+described how machine-readable texts can be used in research.  This latter
+topic received thorough treatment in the paper read by Avra MICHELSON.
+She placed the phenomenon of electronic texts within the context of
+broader trends in information technology and scholarly communication.
+
+Among other things, MICHELSON described on-line conferences that
+represent a vigorous and important intellectual forum for certain
+disciplines.  Internet now carries more than 700 conferences, with about
+80 percent of these devoted to topics in the social sciences and the
+humanities.  Other scholars use on-line networks for "distance learning." 
+Meanwhile, there has been a tremendous growth in end-user computing;
+professors today are less likely than their predecessors to ask the
+campus computer center to process their data.  Electronic texts are one
+key to these sophisticated applications, MICHELSON reported, and more and
+more scholars in the humanities now work in an on-line environment. 
+Toward the end of the Workshop, Michael LESK presented a corollary to
+MICHELSON's talk, reporting the results of an experiment that compared
+the work of one group of chemistry students using traditional printed
+texts and two groups using electronic sources.  The experiment
+demonstrated that in the event one does not know what to read, one needs
+the electronic systems; the electronic systems hold no advantage at the
+moment if one knows what to read, but neither do they impose a penalty.
+
+DALY provided an anecdotal account of the revolutionizing impact of the
+new technology on his previous methods of research in the field of classics.
+His account, by extrapolation, served to illustrate in part the arguments
+made by MICHELSON concerning the positive effects of the sudden and radical
+transformation being wrought in the ways scholars work.
+
+Susan VECCIA and Joanne FREEMAN delineated the use of electronic
+materials outside the university.  The most interesting aspect of their
+use, FREEMAN said, could be seen as a paradox:  teachers in elementary
+and secondary schools requested access to primary source materials but,
+at the same time, found that "primariness" itself made these materials
+difficult for their students to use.
+
+
+OTHER TOPICS
+
+Marybeth PETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States and offered
+advice during a lively discussion of this subject.  But uncertainty
+remains concerning the price of copyright in a digital medium, because a
+solution remains to be worked out concerning management and synthesis of
+copyrighted and out-of-copyright pieces of a database.
+
+As moderator of the final session of the Workshop, Prosser GIFFORD directed
+discussion to future courses of action and the potential role of LC in
+advancing them.  Among the recommendations that emerged were the following:
+
+     * Workshop participants should 1) begin to think about working
+     with image material, but structure and digitize it in such a
+     way that at a later stage it can be interpreted into text, and
+     2) find a common way to build text and images together so that
+     they can be used jointly at some stage in the future, with
+     appropriate network support, because that is how users will want
+     to access these materials.  The Library might encourage attempts
+     to bring together people who are working on texts and images.
+
+     * A network version of American Memory should be developed or
+     consideration should be given to making the data in it
+     available to people interested in doing network multimedia. 
+     Given the current dearth of digital data that is appealing and
+     unencumbered by extremely complex rights problems, developing a
+     network version of American Memory could do much to help make
+     network multimedia a reality.
+
+     * Concerning the thorny issue of electronic deposit, LC should
+     initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed
+     responsibility, that is, bring together the distributed
+     organizations and set up a study group to look at all the
+     issues related to electronic deposit and see where we as a
+     nation should move.  For example, LC might attempt to persuade
+     one major library in each state to deal with its state
+     equivalent publisher, which might produce a cooperative project
+     that would be equitably distributed around the country, and one
+     in which LC would be dealing with a minimal number of publishers
+     and minimal copyright problems.  LC must also deal with the
+     concept of on-line publishing, determining, among other things,
+     how serials such as OJCCT might be deposited for copyright.
+
+     * Since a number of projects are planning to carry out
+     preservation by creating digital images that will end up in
+     on-line or near-line storage at some institution, LC might play
+     a helpful role, at least in the near term, by accelerating how
+     to catalog that information into the Research Library Information
+     Network (RLIN) and then into OCLC, so that it would be accessible.
+     This would reduce the possibility of multiple institutions digitizing
+     the same work. 
+
+
+CONCLUSION
+
+The Workshop was valuable because it brought together partisans from
+various groups and provided an occasion to compare goals and methods. 
+The more committed partisans frequently communicate with others in their
+groups, but less often across group boundaries.  The Workshop was also
+valuable to attendees--including those involved with American Memory--who
+came less committed to particular approaches or concepts.  These
+attendees learned a great deal, and plan to select and employ elements of
+imaging, text-coding, and networked distribution that suit their
+respective projects and purposes.
+
+Still, reality rears its ugly head:  no breakthrough has been achieved. 
+On the imaging side, one confronts a proliferation of competing
+data-interchange standards and a lack of consensus on the role of digital
+facsimiles in preservation.  In the realm of machine-readable texts, one
+encounters a reasonably mature standard but methodological difficulties
+and high costs.  These latter problems, of course, represent a special
+impediment to the desire, as it is sometimes expressed in the popular
+press, "to put the [contents of the] Library of Congress on line."  In
+the words of one participant, there was "no solution to the economic
+problems--the projects that are out there are surviving, but it is going
+to be a lot of work to transform the information industry, and so far the
+investment to do that is not forthcoming" (LESK, per litteras).

+GIFFORD * Origin of Workshop in current Librarian's desire to make LC's
+collections more widely available * Desiderata arising from the prospect
+of greater interconnectedness *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+After welcoming participants on behalf of the Library of Congress,
+American Memory (AM), and the National Demonstration Lab, Prosser
+GIFFORD, director for scholarly programs, Library of Congress, located
+the origin of the Workshop on Electronic Texts in a conversation he had
+had considerably more than a year ago with Carl FLEISCHHAUER concerning
+some of the issues faced by AM.  On the assumption that numerous other
+people were asking the same questions, the decision was made to bring
+together as many of these people as possible to ask the same questions
+together.  In a deeper sense, GIFFORD said, the origin of the Workshop
+lay in the desire of the current Librarian of Congress, James H. 
+Billington, to make the collections of the Library, especially those
+offering unique or unusual testimony on aspects of the American
+experience, available to a much wider circle of users than those few
+people who can come to Washington to use them.  This meant that the
+emphasis of AM, from the outset, has been on archival collections of the
+basic material, and on making these collections themselves available,
+rather than selected or heavily edited products.
+
+From AM's emphasis followed the questions with which the Workshop began: 
+who will use these materials, and in what form will they wish to use
+them.  But an even larger issue deserving mention, in GIFFORD's view, was
+the phenomenal growth in Internet connectivity.  He expressed the hope
+that the prospect of greater interconnectedness than ever before would
+lead to:  1) much more cooperative and mutually supportive endeavors; 2)
+development of systems of shared and distributed responsibilities to
+avoid duplication and to ensure accuracy and preservation of unique
+materials; and 3) agreement on the necessary standards and development of
+the appropriate directories and indices to make navigation
+straightforward among the varied resources that are, and increasingly
+will be, available.  In this connection, GIFFORD requested that
+participants reflect from the outset upon the sorts of outcomes they
+thought the Workshop might have.  Did those present constitute a group
+with sufficient common interests to propose a next step or next steps,
+and if so, what might those be?  They would return to these questions the
+following afternoon.
+

+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+FLEISCHHAUER * Core of Workshop concerns preparation and production of
+materials * Special challenge in conversion of textual materials *
+Quality versus quantity * Do the several groups represented share common
+interests? *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Carl FLEISCHHAUER, coordinator, American Memory, Library of Congress,
+emphasized that he would attempt to represent the people who perform some
+of the work of converting or preparing  materials and that the core of
+the Workshop had to do with preparation and production.  FLEISCHHAUER
+then drew a distinction between the long term, when many things would be
+available and connected in the ways that GIFFORD described, and the short
+term, in which AM not only has wrestled with the issue of what is the
+best course to pursue but also has faced a variety of technical
+challenges.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER remarked AM's endeavors to deal with a wide range of library
+formats, such as motion picture collections, sound-recording collections,
+and pictorial collections of various sorts, especially collections of
+photographs.  In the course of these efforts, AM kept coming back to
+textual materials--manuscripts or rare printed matter, bound materials,
+etc.  Text posed the greatest conversion challenge of all.  Thus, the
+genesis of the Workshop, which reflects the problems faced by AM.  These
+problems include physical problems.  For example, those in the library
+and archive business deal with collections made up of fragile and rare
+manuscript items, bound materials, especially the notoriously brittle
+bound materials of the late nineteenth century.  These are precious
+cultural artifacts, however, as well as interesting sources of
+information, and LC desires to retain and conserve them.  AM needs to
+handle things without damaging them.  Guillotining a book to run it
+through a sheet feeder must be avoided at all costs.
+
+Beyond physical problems, issues pertaining to quality arose.  For
+example, the desire to provide users with a searchable text is affected
+by the question of acceptable level of accuracy.  One hundred percent
+accuracy is tremendously expensive.  On the other hand, the output of
+optical character recognition (OCR) can be tremendously inaccurate. 
+Although AM has attempted to find a middle ground, uncertainty persists
+as to whether or not it has discovered the right solution.
+
+Questions of quality arose concerning images as well.  FLEISCHHAUER
+contrasted the extremely high level of quality of the digital images in
+the Cornell Xerox Project with AM's efforts to provide a browse-quality
+or access-quality image, as opposed to an archival or preservation image. 
+FLEISCHHAUER therefore welcomed the opportunity to compare notes.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER observed in passing that conversations he had had about
+networks have begun to signal that for various forms of media a
+determination may be made that there is a browse-quality item, or a
+distribution-and-access-quality item that may coexist in some systems
+with a higher quality archival item that would be inconvenient to send
+through the network because of its size.  FLEISCHHAUER referred, of
+course, to images more than to searchable text.
+
+As AM considered those questions, several conceptual issues arose:  ought
+AM occasionally to reproduce materials entirely through an image set, at
+other times, entirely through a text set, and in some cases, a mix? 
+There probably would be times when the historical authenticity of an
+artifact would require that its image be used.  An image might be
+desirable as a recourse for users if one could not provide 100-percent
+accurate text.  Again, AM wondered, as a practical matter, if a
+distinction could be drawn between rare printed matter that might exist
+in multiple collections--that is, in ten or fifteen libraries.  In such
+cases, the need for perfect reproduction would be less than for unique
+items.  Implicit in his remarks, FLEISCHHAUER conceded, was the admission
+that AM has been tilting strongly towards quantity and drawing back a
+little from perfect quality.  That is, it seemed to AM that society would
+be better served if more things were distributed by LC--even if they were
+not quite perfect--than if fewer things, perfectly represented, were
+distributed.  This was stated as a proposition to be tested, with
+responses to be gathered from users.
+
+In thinking about issues related to reproduction of materials and seeing
+other people engaged in parallel activities, AM deemed it useful to
+convene a conference.  Hence, the Workshop.  FLEISCHHAUER thereupon
+surveyed the several groups represented:  1) the world of images (image
+users and image makers); 2) the world of text and scholarship and, within
+this group, those concerned with language--FLEISCHHAUER confessed to finding
+delightful irony in the fact that some of the most advanced thinkers on
+computerized texts are those dealing with ancient Greek and Roman materials;
+3) the network world; and 4) the general world of library science, which
+includes people interested in preservation and cataloging.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER concluded his remarks with special thanks to the David and
+Lucile Packard Foundation for its support of the meeting, the American
+Memory group, the Office for Scholarly Programs, the National
+Demonstration Lab, and the Office of Special Events.  He expressed the
+hope that David Woodley Packard might be able to attend, noting that
+Packard's work and the work of the foundation had sponsored a number of
+projects in the text area.

+SESSION I.  CONTENT IN A NEW FORM:   WHO WILL USE IT AND WHAT WILL THEY DO?
+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+DALY * Acknowledgements * A new Latin authors disk *  Effects of the new
+technology on previous methods of research *       
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Serving as moderator, James DALY acknowledged the generosity of all the
+presenters for giving of their time, counsel, and patience in planning
+the Workshop, as well as of members of the American Memory project and
+other Library of Congress staff, and the David and Lucile Packard
+Foundation and its executive director, Colburn S. Wilbur.
+
+DALY then recounted his visit in March to the Center for Electronic Texts
+in the Humanities (CETH) and the Department of Classics at Rutgers
+University, where an old friend, Lowell Edmunds, introduced him to the
+department's IBYCUS scholarly personal computer, and, in particular, the
+new Latin CD-ROM, containing, among other things, almost all classical
+Latin literary texts through A.D. 200.  Packard Humanities Institute
+(PHI), Los Altos, California, released this disk late in 1991, with a
+nominal triennial licensing fee.
+
+Playing with the disk for an hour or so at Rutgers brought home to DALY
+at once the revolutionizing impact of the new technology on his previous
+methods of research.  Had this disk been available two or three years
+earlier, DALY contended, when he was engaged in preparing a commentary on
+Book 10 of Virgil's Aeneid for Cambridge University Press, he would not
+have required a forty-eight-square-foot table on which to spread the
+numerous, most frequently consulted items, including some ten or twelve
+concordances to key Latin authors, an almost equal number of lexica to
+authors who lacked concordances, and where either lexica or concordances
+were lacking, numerous editions of authors antedating and postdating Virgil.
+
+Nor, when checking each of the average six to seven words contained in
+the Virgilian hexameter for its usage elsewhere in Virgil's works or
+other Latin authors, would DALY have had to maintain the laborious
+mechanical process of flipping through these concordances, lexica, and
+editions each time.  Nor would he have had to frequent as often the
+Milton S. Eisenhower Library at the Johns Hopkins University to consult
+the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae.  Instead of devoting countless hours, or
+the bulk of his research time, to gathering data concerning Virgil's use
+of words, DALY--now freed by PHI's Latin authors disk from the
+tyrannical, yet in some ways paradoxically happy scholarly drudgery--
+would have been able to devote that same bulk of time to analyzing and
+interpreting Virgilian verbal usage.
+
+Citing Theodore Brunner, Gregory Crane, Elli MYLONAS, and Avra MICHELSON,
+DALY argued that this reversal in his style of work, made possible by the
+new technology, would perhaps have resulted in better, more productive
+research.  Indeed, even in the course of his browsing the Latin authors
+disk at Rutgers, its powerful search, retrieval, and highlighting
+capabilities suggested to him several new avenues of research into
+Virgil's use of sound effects.  This anecdotal account, DALY maintained,
+may serve to illustrate in part the sudden and radical transformation
+being wrought in the ways scholars work.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Avra MICHELSON, Archival Research and Evaluation Staff, National Archives
+and Records Administration (NARA), argued that establishing who will use
+electronic texts and what they will use them for involves a consideration
+of both information technology and scholarship trends.  This
+consideration includes several elements related to scholarship and
+technology:  1) the key trends in information technology that are most
+relevant to scholarship; 2) the key trends in the use of currently
+available technology by scholars in the nonscientific community; and 3)
+the relationship between these two very distinct but interrelated trends. 
+The investment in understanding this relationship being made by
+information providers, technologists, and public policy developers, as
+well as by scholars themselves, seems to be pervasive and growing,
+MICHELSON contended.  She drew on collaborative work with Jeff Rothenberg
+on the scholarly use of technology.
+
+MICHELSON sought to place the phenomenon of electronic texts within the
+context of broader trends within information technology and scholarly
+communication.  She argued that electronic texts are of most use to
+researchers to the extent that the researchers' working context (i.e.,
+their relevant bibliographic sources, collegial feedback, analytic tools,
+notes, drafts, etc.), along with their field's primary and secondary
+sources, also is accessible in electronic form and can be integrated in
+ways that are unique to the on-line environment.
+
+Evaluation of the prospects for the use of electronic texts includes two
+elements:  1) an examination of the ways in which researchers currently
+are using electronic texts along with other electronic resources, and 2)
+an analysis of key information technology trends that are affecting the
+long-term conduct of scholarly communication.  MICHELSON limited her
+discussion of the use of electronic texts to the practices of humanists
+and noted that the scientific community was outside the panel's overview.
+
+MICHELSON examined the nature of the current relationship of electronic
+texts in particular, and electronic resources in general, to what she
+maintained were, essentially, five processes of scholarly communication
+in humanities research.  Researchers 1) identify sources, 2) communicate
+with their colleagues, 3) interpret and analyze data, 4) disseminate
+their research findings, and 5) prepare curricula to instruct the next
+generation of scholars and students.  This examination would produce a
+clearer understanding of the synergy among these five processes that
+fuels the tendency of the use of electronic resources for one process to
+stimulate its use for other processes of scholarly communication.
+
+For the first process of scholarly communication, the identification of
+sources, MICHELSON remarked the opportunity scholars now enjoy to
+supplement traditional word-of-mouth searches for sources among their
+colleagues with new forms of electronic searching.  So, for example,
+instead of having to visit the library, researchers are able to explore
+descriptions of holdings in their offices.  Furthermore, if their own
+institutions' holdings prove insufficient, scholars can access more than
+200 major American library catalogues over Internet, including the
+universities of California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. 
+Direct access to the bibliographic databases offers intellectual
+empowerment to scholars by presenting a comprehensive means of browsing
+through libraries from their homes and offices at their convenience.
+
+The second process of communication involves communication among
+scholars.  Beyond the most common methods of communication, scholars are
+using E-mail and a variety of new electronic communications formats
+derived from it for further academic interchange.  E-mail exchanges are
+growing at an astonishing rate, reportedly 15 percent a month.  They
+currently constitute approximately half the traffic on research and
+education networks.  Moreover, the global spread of E-mail has been so
+rapid that it is now possible for American scholars to use it to
+communicate with colleagues in close to 140 other countries.
+
+Other new exchange formats created by scholars and operating on Internet
+include more than 700 conferences, with about 80 percent of these devoted
+to topics in the social sciences and humanities.  The rate of growth of
+these scholarly electronic conferences also is astonishing.  From l990 to
+l991, 200 new conferences were identified on Internet.  From October 1991
+to June 1992, an additional 150 conferences in the social sciences and
+humanities were added to this directory of listings.  Scholars have
+established conferences in virtually every field, within every different
+discipline.  For example, there are currently close to 600 active social
+science and humanities  conferences on topics such as art and
+architecture, ethnomusicology, folklore, Japanese culture, medical
+education, and gifted and talented education.  The appeal to scholars of
+communicating through these conferences is that, unlike any other medium,
+electronic conferences today provide a forum for global communication
+with peers at the front end of the research process.
+
+Interpretation and analysis of sources constitutes the third process of
+scholarly communication that MICHELSON discussed in terms of texts and
+textual resources.  The methods used to analyze sources fall somewhere on
+a continuum from quantitative analysis to qualitative analysis. 
+Typically, evidence is culled and evaluated using methods drawn from both
+ends of this continuum.  At one end, quantitative analysis involves the
+use of mathematical processes such as a count of frequencies and
+distributions of occurrences or, on a higher level, regression analysis. 
+At the other end of the continuum, qualitative analysis typically
+involves nonmathematical processes oriented toward language
+interpretation or the building of theory.  Aspects of this work involve
+the processing--either manual or computational--of large and sometimes
+massive amounts of textual sources, although the use of nontextual
+sources as evidence, such as photographs, sound recordings, film footage,
+and artifacts, is significant as well.
+
+Scholars have discovered that many of the methods of interpretation and
+analysis that are related to both quantitative and qualitative methods
+are processes that can be performed by computers.  For example, computers
+can count.  They can count brush strokes used in a Rembrandt painting or
+perform regression analysis for understanding cause and effect.  By means
+of advanced technologies, computers can recognize patterns, analyze text,
+and model concepts.  Furthermore, computers can complete these processes
+faster with more sources and with greater precision than scholars who
+must rely on manual interpretation of data.  But if scholars are to use
+computers for these processes, source materials must be in a form
+amenable to computer-assisted analysis.  For this reason many scholars,
+once they have identified the sources that are key to their research, are
+converting them to machine-readable form.  Thus, a representative example
+of the numerous textual conversion projects organized by scholars around
+the world in recent years to support computational text analysis is the
+TLG, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae.  This project is devoted to
+converting the extant ancient texts of classical Greece.  (Editor's note: 
+according to the TLG Newsletter of May l992, TLG was in use in thirty-two
+different countries.  This figure updates MICHELSON's previous count by one.)
+
+The scholars performing these conversions have been asked to recognize
+that the electronic sources they are converting for one use possess value
+for other research purposes as well.  As a result, during the past few
+years, humanities scholars have initiated a number of projects to
+increase scholarly access to converted text.  So, for example, the Text
+Encoding Initiative (TEI), about which more is said later in the program,
+was established as an effort by scholars to determine standard elements
+and methods for encoding machine-readable text for electronic exchange. 
+In a second effort to facilitate the sharing of converted text, scholars
+have created a new institution, the Center for Electronic Texts in the
+Humanities (CETH).  The center estimates that there are 8,000 series of
+source texts in the humanities that have been converted to
+machine-readable form worldwide.  CETH is undertaking an international
+search for converted text in the humanities, compiling it into an
+electronic library, and preparing bibliographic descriptions of the
+sources for the Research Libraries Information Network's (RLIN)
+machine-readable data file.  The library profession has begun to initiate
+large conversion projects as well, such as American Memory.
+
+While scholars have been making converted text available to one another,
+typically on disk or on CD-ROM, the clear trend is toward making these
+resources available through research and education networks.  Thus, the
+American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language
+(ARTFL) and the Dante Project are already available on Internet. 
+MICHELSON summarized this section on interpretation and analysis by
+noting that:  1) increasing numbers of humanities scholars in the library
+community are recognizing the importance to the advancement of
+scholarship of retrospective conversion of source materials in the arts
+and humanities; and 2) there is a growing realization that making the
+sources available on research and education networks maximizes their
+usefulness for the analysis performed by humanities scholars.
+
+The fourth process of scholarly communication is dissemination of
+research findings, that is, publication.  Scholars are using existing
+research and education networks to engineer a new type of publication: 
+scholarly-controlled journals that are electronically produced and
+disseminated.  Although such journals are still emerging as a
+communication format, their number has grown, from approximately twelve
+to thirty-six during the past year (July 1991 to June 1992).  Most of
+these electronic scholarly journals are devoted to topics in the
+humanities.  As with network conferences, scholarly enthusiasm for these
+electronic journals stems from the medium's unique ability to advance
+scholarship in a way that no other medium can do by supporting global
+feedback and interchange, practically in real time, early in the research
+process.  Beyond scholarly journals, MICHELSON remarked the delivery of
+commercial full-text products, such as articles in professional journals,
+newsletters, magazines, wire services, and reference sources.  These are
+being delivered via on-line local library catalogues, especially through
+CD-ROMs.  Furthermore, according to MICHELSON, there is general optimism
+that the copyright and fees issues impeding the delivery of full text on
+existing research and education networks soon will be resolved.
+
+The final process of scholarly communication is curriculum development
+and instruction, and this involves the use of computer information
+technologies in two areas.  The first is the development of
+computer-oriented instructional tools, which includes simulations,
+multimedia applications, and computer tools that are used to assist in
+the analysis of sources in the classroom, etc.  The Perseus Project, a
+database that provides a multimedia curriculum on classical Greek
+civilization, is a good example of the way in which entire curricula are
+being recast using information technologies.  It is anticipated that the
+current difficulty in exchanging electronically computer-based
+instructional software, which in turn makes it difficult for one scholar
+to build upon the work of others, will be resolved before too long. 
+Stand-alone curricular applications that involve electronic text will be
+sharable through networks, reinforcing their significance as intellectual
+products as well as instructional tools.
+
+The second aspect of electronic learning involves the use of research and
+education networks for distance education programs.  Such programs
+interactively link teachers with students in geographically scattered
+locations and rely on the availability of electronic instructional
+resources.  Distance education programs are gaining wide appeal among
+state departments of education because of their demonstrated capacity to
+bring advanced specialized course work and an array of experts to many
+classrooms.  A recent report found that at least 32 states operated at
+least one statewide network for education in 1991, with networks under
+development in many of the remaining states.
+
+MICHELSON summarized this section by noting two striking changes taking
+place in scholarly communication among humanities scholars.  First is the
+extent to which electronic text in particular, and electronic resources
+in general, are being infused into each of the five processes described
+above.  As mentioned earlier, there is a certain synergy at work here. 
+The use of electronic resources for one process tends to stimulate its
+use for other processes, because the chief course of movement is toward a
+comprehensive on-line working context for humanities scholars that
+includes on-line availability of key bibliographies, scholarly feedback,
+sources, analytical tools, and publications.  MICHELSON noted further
+that the movement toward a comprehensive on-line working context for
+humanities scholars is not new.  In fact, it has been underway for more
+than forty years in the humanities, since Father Roberto Busa began
+developing an electronic concordance of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas
+in 1949.  What we are witnessing today, MICHELSON contended, is not the
+beginning of this on-line transition but, for at least some humanities
+scholars, the turning point in the transition from a print to an
+electronic working context.  Coinciding with the on-line transition, the
+second striking change is the extent to which research and education
+networks are becoming the new medium of scholarly communication.  The
+existing Internet and the pending National Education and Research Network
+(NREN) represent the new meeting ground where scholars are going for
+bibliographic information, scholarly dialogue and feedback, the most
+current publications in their field, and high-level educational
+offerings.  Traditional scholarly practices are undergoing tremendous
+transformations as a result of the emergence and growing prominence of
+what is called network-mediated scholarship.
+
+MICHELSON next turned to the second element of the framework she proposed
+at the outset of her talk for evaluating the prospects for electronic
+text, namely the key information technology trends affecting the conduct
+of scholarly communication over the next decade:  1) end-user computing
+and 2) connectivity.
+
+End-user computing means that the person touching the keyboard, or
+performing computations, is the same as the person who initiates or
+consumes the computation.  The emergence of personal computers, along
+with a host of other forces, such as ubiquitous computing, advances in
+interface design, and the on-line transition, is prompting the consumers
+of computation to do their own computing, and is thus rendering obsolete
+the traditional distinction between end users and ultimate users.
+
+The trend toward end-user computing is significant to consideration of
+the prospects for electronic texts because it means that researchers are
+becoming more adept at doing their own computations and, thus, more
+competent in the use of electronic media.  By avoiding programmer
+intermediaries, computation is becoming central to the researcher's
+thought process.  This direct involvement in computing is changing the
+researcher's perspective on the nature of research itself, that is, the
+kinds of questions that can be posed, the analytical methodologies that
+can be used, the types and amount of sources that are appropriate for
+analyses, and the form in which findings are presented.  The trend toward
+end-user computing means that, increasingly, electronic media and
+computation are being infused into all processes of humanities
+scholarship, inspiring remarkable transformations in scholarly
+communication.
+
+The trend toward greater connectivity suggests that researchers are using
+computation increasingly in network environments.  Connectivity is
+important to scholarship because it erases the distance that separates
+students from teachers and scholars from their colleagues, while allowing
+users to access remote databases, share information in many different
+media, connect to their working context wherever they are, and
+collaborate in all phases of research.
+
+The combination of the trend toward end-user computing and the trend
+toward connectivity suggests that the scholarly use of electronic
+resources, already evident among some researchers, will soon become an
+established feature of scholarship.  The effects of these trends, along
+with ongoing changes in scholarly practices, point to a future in which
+humanities researchers will use computation and electronic communication
+to help them formulate ideas, access sources, perform research,
+collaborate with colleagues, seek peer review, publish and disseminate
+results, and engage in many other professional and educational activities.
+
+In summary, MICHELSON emphasized four points:  1) A portion of humanities
+scholars already consider electronic texts the preferred format for
+analysis and dissemination.  2) Scholars are using these electronic
+texts, in conjunction with other electronic resources, in all the
+processes of scholarly communication.  3) The humanities scholars'
+working context is in the process of changing from print technology to
+electronic technology, in many ways mirroring transformations that have
+occurred or are occurring within the scientific community.  4) These
+changes are occurring in conjunction with the development of a new
+communication medium:  research and education networks that are
+characterized by their capacity to advance scholarship in a wholly unique
+way.
+
+MICHELSON also reiterated her three principal arguments:  l) Electronic
+texts are best understood in terms of the relationship to other
+electronic resources and the growing prominence of network-mediated
+scholarship.  2) The prospects for electronic texts lie in their capacity
+to be integrated into the on-line network of electronic resources that
+comprise the new working context for scholars.  3) Retrospective conversion
+of portions of the scholarly record should be a key strategy as information
+providers respond to changes in scholarly communication practices.

+
+Susan VECCIA, team leader, and Joanne FREEMAN, associate coordinator,
+American Memory, Library of Congress, gave a joint presentation.  First,
+by way of introduction, VECCIA explained her and FREEMAN's roles in
+American Memory (AM).  Serving principally as an observer, VECCIA has
+assisted with the evaluation project of AM, placing AM collections in a
+variety of different sites around the country and helping to organize and
+implement that project.  FREEMAN has been an associate coordinator of AM
+and has been involved principally with the interpretative materials,
+preparing some of the electronic exhibits and printed historical
+information that accompanies AM and that is requested by users.  VECCIA
+and FREEMAN shared anecdotal observations concerning AM with public users
+of electronic resources.  Notwithstanding a fairly structured evaluation
+in progress, both VECCIA and FREEMAN chose not to report on specifics in
+terms of numbers, etc., because they felt it was too early in the
+evaluation project to do so.
+
+AM is an electronic archive of primary source materials from the Library
+of Congress, selected collections representing a variety of formats--
+photographs, graphic arts, recorded sound, motion pictures, broadsides,
+and soon, pamphlets and books.  In terms of the design of this system,
+the interpretative exhibits have been kept separate from the primary
+resources, with good reason.  Accompanying this collection are printed
+documentation and user guides, as well as guides that FREEMAN prepared for
+teachers so that they may begin using the content of the system at once.
+
+VECCIA described the evaluation project before talking about the public
+users of AM, limiting her remarks to public libraries, because FREEMAN
+would talk more specifically about schools from kindergarten to twelfth
+grade (K-12).   Having started in spring 1991, the evaluation currently
+involves testing of the Macintosh implementation of AM.  Since the
+primary goal of this evaluation is to determine the most appropriate
+audience or audiences for AM, very different sites were selected.  This
+makes evaluation difficult because of the varying degrees of technology
+literacy among the sites.  AM is situated in forty-four locations, of
+which six are public libraries and sixteen are schools.  Represented
+among the schools are elementary, junior high, and high schools.
+District offices also are involved in the evaluation, which will
+conclude in summer 1993.
+
+VECCIA focused the remainder of her talk on the six public libraries, one
+of which doubles as a state library.  They represent a range of
+geographic areas and a range of demographic characteristics.  For
+example, three are located in urban settings, two in rural settings, and
+one in a suburban setting.  A range of technical expertise is to be found
+among these facilities as well.  For example, one is an "Apple library of
+the future," while two others are rural one-room libraries--in one, AM
+sits at the front desk next to a tractor manual.
+
+All public libraries have been extremely enthusiastic, supportive, and
+appreciative of the work that AM has been doing.  VECCIA characterized
+various users:  Most users in public libraries describe themselves as
+general readers; of the students who use AM in the public libraries,
+those in fourth grade and above seem most interested.  Public libraries
+in rural sites tend to attract retired people, who have been highly
+receptive to AM.  Users tend to fall into two additional categories: 
+people interested in the content and historical connotations of these
+primary resources, and those fascinated by the technology.  The format
+receiving the most comments has been motion pictures.  The adult users in
+public libraries are more comfortable with IBM computers, whereas young
+people seem comfortable with either IBM or Macintosh, although most of
+them seem to come from a Macintosh background.  This same tendency is
+found in the schools.
+
+What kinds of things do users do with AM?  In a public library there are
+two main goals or ways that AM is being used:  as an individual learning
+tool, and as a leisure activity.  Adult learning was one area that VECCIA
+would highlight as a possible application for a tool such as AM.  She
+described a patron of a rural public library who comes in every day on
+his lunch hour and literally reads AM, methodically going through the
+collection image by image.  At the end of his hour he makes an electronic
+bookmark, puts it in his pocket, and returns to work.  The next day he
+comes in and resumes where he left off.  Interestingly, this man had
+never been in the library before he used AM.  In another small, rural
+library, the coordinator reports that AM is a popular activity for some
+of the older, retired people in the community, who ordinarily would not
+use "those things,"--computers.  Another example of adult learning in
+public libraries is book groups, one of which, in particular, is using AM
+as part of its reading on industrialization, integration, and urbanization
+in the early 1900s.
+
+One library reports that a family is using AM to help educate their
+children.  In another instance, individuals from a local museum came in
+to use AM to prepare an exhibit on toys of the past.  These two examples
+emphasize the mission of the public library as a cultural institution,
+reaching out to people who do not have the same resources available to
+those who live in a metropolitan area or have access to a major library. 
+One rural library reports that junior high school students in large
+numbers came in one afternoon to use AM for entertainment.  A number of
+public libraries reported great interest among postcard collectors in the
+Detroit collection, which was essentially a collection of images used on
+postcards around the turn of the century.  Train buffs are similarly
+interested because that was a time of great interest in railroading. 
+People, it was found, relate to things that they know of firsthand.  For
+example, in both rural public libraries where AM was made available,
+observers reported that the older people with personal remembrances of
+the turn of the century were gravitating to the Detroit collection. 
+These examples served to underscore MICHELSON's observation re the
+integration of electronic tools and ideas--that people learn best when
+the material relates to something they know.
+
+VECCIA made the final point that in many cases AM serves as a
+public-relations tool for the public libraries that are testing it.  In
+one case, AM is being used as a vehicle to secure additional funding for
+the library.  In another case, AM has served as an inspiration to the
+staff of a major local public library in the South to think about ways to
+make its own collection of photographs more accessible to the public.

+FREEMAN * AM and archival electronic resources in a school environment *
+Questions concerning context * Questions concerning the electronic format
+itself * Computer anxiety * Access and availability of the system *
+Hardware * Strengths gained through the use of archival resources in
+schools *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Reiterating an observation made by VECCIA, that AM is an archival
+resource made up of primary materials with very little interpretation,
+FREEMAN stated that the project has attempted to bridge the gap between
+these bare primary materials and a school environment, and in that cause
+has created guided introductions to AM collections.  Loud demand from the
+educational community,  chiefly from teachers working with the upper
+grades of elementary school through high school, greeted the announcement
+that AM would be tested around the country.
+
+FREEMAN reported not only on what was learned about AM in a school
+environment, but also on several universal questions that were raised
+concerning archival electronic resources in schools.  She discussed
+several strengths of this type of material in a school environment as
+opposed to a highly structured resource that offers a limited number of
+paths to follow.
+
+FREEMAN first raised several questions about using AM in a school
+environment.  There is often some difficulty in developing a sense of
+what the system contains.  Many students sit down at a computer resource
+and assume that, because AM comes from the Library of Congress, all of
+American history is now at their fingertips.  As a result of that sort of
+mistaken judgment, some students are known to conclude that AM contains
+nothing of use to them when they look for one or two things and do not
+find them.  It is difficult to discover that middle ground where one has
+a sense of what the system contains.  Some students grope toward the idea
+of an archive, a new idea to them, since they have not previously
+experienced what it means to have access to a vast body of somewhat
+random information.
+
+Other questions raised by FREEMAN concerned the electronic format itself. 
+For instance, in a school environment it is often difficult both for
+teachers and students to gain a sense of what it is they are viewing. 
+They understand that it is a visual image, but they do not necessarily
+know that it is a postcard from the turn of the century, a panoramic
+photograph, or even machine-readable text of an eighteenth-century
+broadside, a twentieth-century printed book, or a nineteenth-century
+diary.  That distinction is often difficult for people in a school
+environment to grasp.  Because of that, it occasionally becomes difficult
+to draw conclusions from what one is viewing.
+
+FREEMAN also noted the obvious fear of the computer, which constitutes a
+difficulty in using an electronic resource.  Though students in general
+did not suffer from this anxiety, several older students feared that they
+were computer-illiterate, an assumption that became self-fulfilling when
+they searched for something but failed to find it.  FREEMAN said she
+believed that some teachers also fear computer resources, because they
+believe they lack complete control.  FREEMAN related the example of
+teachers shooing away students because it was not their time to use the
+system.  This was a case in which the situation had to be extremely
+structured so that the teachers would not feel that they had lost their
+grasp on what the system contained.
+
+A final question raised by FREEMAN concerned access and availability of
+the system.  She noted the occasional existence of a gap in communication
+between school librarians and teachers.  Often AM sits in a school
+library and the librarian is the person responsible for monitoring the
+system.  Teachers do not always take into their world new library
+resources about which the librarian is excited.  Indeed, at the sites
+where AM had been used most effectively within a library, the librarian
+was required to go to specific teachers and instruct them in its use.  As
+a result, several AM sites will have in-service sessions over a summer,
+in the hope that perhaps, with a more individualized link, teachers will
+be more likely to use the resource.
+
+A related issue in the school context concerned the number of
+workstations available at any one location.  Centralization of equipment
+at the district level, with teachers invited to download things and walk
+away with them, proved unsuccessful because the hours these offices were
+open were also school hours.
+
+Another issue was hardware.  As VECCIA observed, a range of sites exists,
+some technologically advanced and others essentially acquiring their
+first computer for the primary purpose of using it in conjunction with
+AM's testing.  Users at technologically sophisticated sites want even
+more sophisticated hardware, so that they can perform even more
+sophisticated tasks with the materials in AM.  But once they acquire a
+newer piece of hardware, they must learn how to use that also; at an
+unsophisticated site it takes an extremely long time simply to become
+accustomed to the computer, not to mention the program offered with the
+computer.  All of these small issues raise one large question, namely,
+are systems like AM truly rewarding in a school environment, or do they
+simply act as innovative toys that do little more than spark interest?
+
+FREEMAN contended that the evaluation project has revealed several strengths
+that were gained through the use of archival resources in schools, including:
+
+     * Psychic rewards from using AM as a vast, rich database, with
+     teachers assigning various projects to students--oral presentations,
+     written reports, a documentary, a turn-of-the-century newspaper--
+     projects that start with the materials in AM but are completed using
+     other resources; AM thus is used as a research tool in conjunction
+     with other electronic resources, as well as with books and items in
+     the library where the system is set up.
+
+     * Students are acquiring computer literacy in a humanities context.
+
+     * This sort of system is overcoming the isolation between disciplines
+     that often exists in schools.  For example, many English teachers are
+     requiring their students to write papers on historical topics
+     represented in AM.  Numerous teachers have reported that their
+     students are learning critical thinking skills using the system.
+
+     * On a broader level, AM is introducing primary materials, not only
+     to students but also to teachers, in an environment where often
+     simply none exist--an exciting thing for the students because it
+     helps them learn to conduct research, to interpret, and to draw
+     their own conclusions.  In learning to conduct research and what it
+     means, students are motivated to seek knowledge.  That relates to
+     another positive outcome--a high level of personal involvement of
+     students with the materials in this system and greater motivation to
+     conduct their own research and draw their own conclusions.
+
+     * Perhaps the most ironic strength of these kinds of archival
+     electronic resources is that many of the teachers AM interviewed
+     were desperate, it is no exaggeration to say, not only for primary
+     materials but for unstructured primary materials.  These would, they
+     thought, foster personally motivated research, exploration, and
+     excitement in their students.  Indeed, these materials have done
+     just that.  Ironically, however, this lack of structure produces
+     some of the confusion to which the newness of these kinds of
+     resources may also contribute.  The key to effective use of archival
+     products in a school environment is a clear, effective introduction
+     to the system and to what it contains.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+During the discussion that followed the presentations by MICHELSON,
+VECCIA, and FREEMAN, additional points emerged.
+
+LESK asked if MICHELSON could give any quantitative estimate of the
+number of humanities scholars who must see or want to see the original,
+or the best possible version of the material, versus those who typically
+would settle for an edited transcript.  While unable to provide a figure,
+she offered her impressions as an archivist who has done some reference
+work and has discussed this issue with other archivists who perform
+reference, that those who use archives and those who use primary sources
+for what would be considered very high-level scholarly research, as
+opposed to, say, undergraduate papers, were few in number, especially
+given the public interest in using primary sources to conduct
+genealogical or avocational research and the kind of professional
+research done by people in private industry or the federal government. 
+More important in MICHELSON's view was that, quantitatively, nothing is
+known about the ways in which, for example, humanities scholars are using
+information technology.  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating
+strategies.  The most recent study was conducted in 1985 by the American
+Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), and what it showed was that 50
+percent of humanities scholars at that time were using computers.  That
+constitutes the extent of our knowledge.
+
+Concerning AM's strategy for orienting people toward the scope of
+electronic resources, FREEMAN could offer no hard conclusions at this
+point, because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see,
+particularly in the schools, what has been made of their efforts.  Within
+the system, however, AM has provided what are called electronic exhibits-
+-such as introductions to time periods and materials--and these are
+intended to offer a student user a sense of what a broadside is  and what
+it might tell her or him.  But FREEMAN conceded that the project staff
+would have to talk with students next year, after teachers have had a
+summer to use the materials, and attempt to discover what the students
+were learning from the materials.  In addition, FREEMAN described
+supporting materials in print provided by AM at the request of local
+teachers during a meeting held at LC.  These included time lines,
+bibliographies, and other materials that could be reproduced on a
+photocopier in a classroom.  Teachers could walk away with and use these,
+and in this way gain a better understanding of the contents.  But again,
+reaching firm conclusions concerning the manner and extent of their use
+would have to wait until next year.
+
+As to the changes she saw occurring at the National Archives and Records
+Administration (NARA) as a result of the increasing emphasis on
+technology in scholarly research, MICHELSON stated that NARA at this
+point was absorbing the report by her and Jeff Rothenberg addressing
+strategies for the archival profession in general, although not for the
+National Archives specifically.  NARA is just beginning to establish its
+role and what it can do.  In terms of changes and initiatives that NARA
+can take, no clear response could be given at this time.
+
+GREENFIELD remarked two trends mentioned in the session.  Reflecting on
+DALY's opening comments on how he could have used a Latin collection of
+text in an electronic form, he said that at first he thought most scholars
+would be unwilling to do that.  But as he thought of that in terms of the
+original meaning of research--that is, having already mastered these texts,
+researching them for critical and comparative purposes--for the first time,
+the electronic format made a lot of sense.  GREENFIELD could envision
+growing numbers of scholars learning the new technologies for that very
+aspect of their scholarship and for convenience's sake.
+
+Listening to VECCIA and FREEMAN, GREENFIELD thought of an additional
+application of electronic texts.  He realized that AM could be used as a
+guide to lead someone to original sources.  Students cannot be expected
+to have mastered these sources, things they have never known about
+before.  Thus, AM is leading them, in theory, to a vast body of
+information and giving them a superficial overview of it, enabling them
+to select parts of it.  GREENFIELD asked if any evidence exists that this
+resource will indeed teach the new user, the K-12 students, how to do
+research.  Scholars already know how to do research and are applying
+these new tools.  But he wondered why students would go beyond picking
+out things that were most exciting to them.
+
+FREEMAN conceded the correctness of GREENFIELD's observation as applied
+to a school environment.  The risk is that a student would sit down at a
+system, play with it, find some things of interest, and then walk away. 
+But in the relatively controlled situation of a school library, much will
+depend on the instructions a teacher or a librarian gives a student.  She
+viewed the situation not as one of fine-tuning research skills but of
+involving students at a personal level in understanding and researching
+things.  Given the guidance one can receive at school, it then becomes
+possible to teach elementary research skills to students, which in fact
+one particular librarian said she was teaching her fifth graders. 
+FREEMAN concluded that introducing the idea of following one's own path
+of inquiry, which is essentially what research entails, involves more
+than teaching specific skills.  To these comments VECCIA added the
+observation that the individual teacher and the use of a creative
+resource, rather than AM itself, seemed to make the key difference.
+Some schools and some teachers are making excellent use of the nature
+of critical thinking and teaching skills, she said.
+
+Concurring with these remarks, DALY closed the session with the thought that
+the more that producers produced for teachers and for scholars to use with
+their students, the more successful their electronic products would prove.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Elli MYLONAS, managing editor, Perseus Project, Harvard University, first
+gave an overview of Perseus, a large, collaborative effort based at
+Harvard University but with contributors and collaborators located at
+numerous universities and colleges in the United States (e.g., Bowdoin,
+Maryland, Pomona, Chicago, Virginia).  Funded primarily by the
+Annenberg/CPB Project, with additional funding from Apple, Harvard, and
+the Packard Humanities Institute, among others, Perseus is a multimedia,
+hypertextual database for teaching and research on classical Greek
+civilization, which was released in February 1992 in version 1.0 and
+distributed by Yale University Press.
+
+Consisting entirely of primary materials, Perseus includes ancient Greek
+texts and translations of those texts; catalog entries--that is, museum
+catalog entries, not library catalog entries--on vases, sites, coins,
+sculpture, and archaeological objects; maps; and a dictionary, among
+other sources.  The number of objects and the objects for which catalog
+entries exist are accompanied by thousands of color images, which
+constitute a major feature of the database.  Perseus contains
+approximately 30 megabytes of text, an amount that will double in
+subsequent versions.  In addition to these primary materials, the Perseus
+Project has been building tools for using them, making access and
+navigation easier, the goal being to build part of the electronic
+environment discussed earlier in the morning in which students or
+scholars can work with their sources.
+
+The demonstration of Perseus will show only a fraction of the real work
+that has gone into it, because the project had to face the dilemma of
+what to enter when putting something into machine-readable form:  should
+one aim for very high quality or make concessions in order to get the
+material in?  Since Perseus decided to opt for very high quality, all of
+its primary materials exist in a system-independent--insofar as it is
+possible to be system-independent--archival form.  Deciding what that
+archival form would be and attaining it required much work and thought. 
+For example, all the texts are marked up in SGML, which will be made
+compatible with the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) when
+they are issued.
+
+Drawings are postscript files, not meeting international standards, but
+at least designed to go across platforms.  Images, or rather the real
+archival forms, consist of the best available slides, which are being
+digitized.  Much of the catalog material exists in database form--a form
+that the average user could use, manipulate, and display on a personal
+computer, but only at great cost.  Thus, this is where the concession
+comes in:  All of this rich, well-marked-up information is stripped of
+much of its content; the images are converted into bit-maps and the text
+into small formatted chunks.  All this information can then be imported
+into HyperCard and run on a mid-range Macintosh, which is what Perseus
+users have.  This fact has made it possible for Perseus to attain wide
+use fairly rapidly.  Without those archival forms the HyperCard version
+being demonstrated could not be made easily, and the project could not
+have the potential to move to other forms and machines and software as
+they appear, none of which information is in Perseus on the CD.
+
+Of the numerous multimedia aspects of Perseus, MYLONAS focused on the
+textual.  Part of what makes Perseus such a pleasure to use, MYLONAS
+said, is this effort at seamless integration and the ability to move
+around both visual and textual material.  Perseus also made the decision
+not to attempt to interpret its material any more than one interprets by
+selecting.  But, MYLONAS emphasized, Perseus is not courseware:  No
+syllabus exists.  There is no effort to define how one teaches a topic
+using Perseus, although the project may eventually collect papers by
+people who have used it to teach.  Rather, Perseus aims to provide
+primary material in a kind of electronic library, an electronic sandbox,
+so to say, in which students and scholars who are working on this
+material can explore by themselves.  With that, MYLONAS demonstrated
+Perseus, beginning with the Perseus gateway, the first thing one sees
+upon opening Perseus--an effort in part to solve the contextualizing
+problem--which tells the user what the system contains.
+
+MYLONAS demonstrated only a very small portion, beginning with primary
+texts and running off the CD-ROM.  Having selected Aeschylus' Prometheus
+Bound, which was viewable in Greek and English pretty much in the same
+segments together, MYLONAS demonstrated tools to use with the Greek text,
+something not possible with a book:  looking up the dictionary entry form
+of an unfamiliar word in Greek after subjecting it to Perseus'
+morphological analysis for all the texts.  After finding out about a
+word, a user may then decide to see if it is used anywhere else in Greek. 
+Because vast amounts of indexing support all of the primary material, one
+can find out where else all forms of a particular Greek word appear--
+often not a trivial matter because Greek is highly inflected.  Further,
+since the story of Prometheus has to do with the origins of sacrifice, a
+user may wish to study and explore sacrifice in Greek literature; by
+typing sacrifice into a small window, a user goes to the English-Greek
+word list--something one cannot do without the computer (Perseus has
+indexed the definitions of its dictionary)--the string sacrifice appears
+in the definitions of these sixty-five words.  One may then find out
+where any of those words is used in the work(s) of a particular author. 
+The English definitions are not lemmatized.
+
+All of the indices driving this kind of usage were originally devised for
+speed, MYLONAS observed; in other words, all that kind of information--
+all forms of all words, where they exist, the dictionary form they belong
+to--were collected into databases, which will expedite searching.  Then
+it was discovered that one can do things searching in these databases
+that could not be done searching in the full texts.  Thus, although there
+are full-text searches in Perseus, much of the work is done behind the
+scenes, using prepared indices.  Re the indexing that is done behind the
+scenes, MYLONAS pointed out that without the SGML forms of the text, it
+could not be done effectively.  Much of this indexing is based on the
+structures that are made explicit by the SGML tagging.
+
+It was found that one of the things many of Perseus' non-Greek-reading
+users do is start from the dictionary and then move into the close study
+of words and concepts via this kind of English-Greek word search, by which
+means they might select a concept.  This exercise has been assigned to
+students in core courses at Harvard--to study a concept by looking for the
+English word in the dictionary, finding the Greek words, and then finding
+the words in the Greek but, of course, reading across in the English.
+That tells them a great deal about what a translation means as well.
+
+Should one also wish to see images that have to do with sacrifice, that
+person would go to the object key word search, which allows one to
+perform a similar kind of index retrieval on the database of
+archaeological objects.  Without words, pictures are useless; Perseus has
+not reached the point where it can do much with images that are not
+cataloged.  Thus, although it is possible in Perseus with text and images
+to navigate by knowing where one wants to end up--for example, a
+red-figure vase from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts--one can perform this
+kind of navigation very easily by tracing down indices.  MYLONAS
+illustrated several generic scenes of sacrifice on vases.  The features
+demonstrated derived from Perseus 1.0; version 2.0 will implement even
+better means of retrieval.

+DISCUSSION * Indexing and searchability of all English words in Perseus *
+Several features of Perseus 1.0 * Several levels of customization
+possible * Perseus used for general education * Perseus' effects on
+education * Contextual information in Perseus * Main challenge and
+emphasis of Perseus *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Several points emerged in the discussion that followed MYLONAS's presentation.
+
+Although MYLONAS had not demonstrated Perseus' ability to cross-search
+documents, she confirmed that all English words in Perseus are indexed
+and can be searched.  So, for example, sacrifice could have been searched
+in all texts, the historical essay, and all the catalogue entries with
+their descriptions--in short, in all of Perseus.
+
+Boolean logic is not in Perseus 1.0 but will be added to the next
+version, although an effort is being made not to restrict Perseus to a
+database in which one just performs searching, Boolean or otherwise.  It
+is possible to move laterally through the documents by selecting a word
+one is interested in and selecting an area of information one is
+interested in and trying to look that word up in that area.
+
+Since Perseus was developed in HyperCard, several levels of customization
+are possible.  Simple authoring tools exist that allow one to create
+annotated paths through the information, which are useful for note-taking
+and for guided tours for teaching purposes and for expository writing. 
+With a little more ingenuity it is possible to begin to add or substitute
+material in Perseus.
+
+Perseus has not been used so much for classics education as for general
+education, where it seemed to have an impact on the students in the core
+course at Harvard (a general required course that students must take in
+certain areas).  Students were able to use primary material much more.
+
+The Perseus Project has an evaluation team at the University of Maryland
+that has been documenting Perseus' effects on education.  Perseus is very
+popular, and anecdotal evidence indicates that it is having an effect at
+places other than Harvard, for example, test sites at Ball State
+University, Drury College, and numerous small places where opportunities
+to use vast amounts of primary data may not exist.  One documented effect
+is that archaeological, anthropological, and philological research is
+being done by the same person instead of by three different people.
+
+The contextual information in Perseus includes an overview essay, a
+fairly linear historical essay on the fifth century B.C. that provides
+links into the primary material (e.g., Herodotus, Thucydides, and
+Plutarch), via small gray underscoring (on the screen) of linked
+passages.  These are handmade links into other material.
+
+To different extents, most of the production work was done at Harvard,
+where the people and the equipment are located.  Much of the
+collaborative activity involved data collection and structuring, because
+the main challenge and the emphasis of Perseus is the gathering of
+primary material, that is, building a useful environment for studying
+classical Greece, collecting data, and making it useful. 
+Systems-building is definitely not the main concern.  Thus, much of the
+work has involved writing essays, collecting information, rewriting it,
+and tagging it.  That can be done off site.  The creative link for the
+overview essay as well as for both systems and data was collaborative,
+and was forged via E-mail and paper mail with professors at Pomona and
+Bowdoin.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Eric CALALUCA, vice president, Chadwyck-Healey, Inc., demonstrated a
+software interpretation of the Patrologia Latina Database (PLD).  PLD's
+principal focus from the beginning of the project about three-and-a-half
+years ago was on converting Migne's Latin series, and in the end,
+CALALUCA suggested, conversion of the text will be the major contribution
+to scholarship.  CALALUCA stressed that, as possibly the only private
+publishing organization at the Workshop, Chadwyck-Healey had sought no
+federal funds or national foundation support before embarking upon the
+project, but instead had relied upon a great deal of homework and
+marketing to accomplish the task of conversion.
+
+Ever since the possibilities of computer-searching have emerged, scholars
+in the field of late ancient and early medieval studies (philosophers,
+theologians, classicists, and those studying the history of natural law
+and the history of the legal development of Western civilization) have
+been longing for a fully searchable version of Western literature, for
+example, all the texts of Augustine and Bernard of Clairvaux and
+Boethius, not to mention all the secondary and tertiary authors.
+
+Various questions arose, CALALUCA said.  Should one convert Migne? 
+Should the database be encoded?  Is it necessary to do that?  How should
+it be delivered?  What about CD-ROM?  Since this is a transitional
+medium, why even bother to create software to run on a CD-ROM?  Since
+everybody knows people will be networking information, why go to the
+trouble--which is far greater with CD-ROM than with the production of
+magnetic data?  Finally, how does one make the data available?  Can many
+of the hurdles to using electronic information that some publishers have
+imposed upon databases be eliminated?
+
+The PLD project was based on the principle that computer-searching of
+texts is most effective when it is done with a large database.  Because
+PLD represented a collection that serves so many disciplines across so
+many periods, it was irresistible.
+
+The basic rule in converting PLD was to do no harm, to avoid the sins of
+intrusion in such a database:  no introduction of newer editions, no
+on-the-spot changes, no eradicating of all possible falsehoods from an
+edition.  Thus, PLD is not the final act in electronic publishing for
+this discipline, but simply the beginning.  The conversion of PLD has
+evoked numerous unanticipated questions:  How will information be used? 
+What about networking?  Can the rights of a database be protected? 
+Should one protect the rights of a database?  How can it be made
+available?
+
+Those converting PLD also tried to avoid the sins of omission, that is,
+excluding portions of the collections or whole sections.  What about the
+images?  PLD is full of images, some are extremely pious
+nineteenth-century representations of the Fathers, while others contain
+highly interesting elements.  The goal was to cover all the text of Migne
+(including notes, in Greek and in Hebrew, the latter of which, in
+particular, causes problems in creating a search structure), all the
+indices, and even the images, which are being scanned in separately
+searchable files.
+
+Several North American institutions that have placed acquisition requests
+for the PLD database have requested it in magnetic form without software,
+which means they are already running it without software, without
+anything demonstrated at the Workshop.
+
+What cannot practically be done is go back and reconvert and re-encode
+data, a time-consuming and extremely costly enterprise.  CALALUCA sees
+PLD as a database that can, and should, be run under a variety of
+retrieval softwares.  This will permit the widest possible searches. 
+Consequently, the need to produce a CD-ROM of PLD, as well as to develop
+software that could handle some 1.3 gigabyte of heavily encoded text,
+developed out of conversations with collection development and reference
+librarians who wanted software both compassionate enough for the
+pedestrian but also capable of incorporating the most detailed
+lexicographical studies that a user desires to conduct.  In the end, the
+encoding and conversion of the data will prove the most enduring
+testament to the value of the project.
+
+The encoding of the database was also a hard-fought issue:  Did the
+database need to be encoded? Were there normative structures for encoding
+humanist texts?  Should it be SGML?  What about the TEI--will it last,
+will it prove useful?  CALALUCA expressed some minor doubts as to whether
+a data bank can be fully TEI-conformant.  Every effort can be made, but
+in the end to be TEI-conformant means to accept the need to make some
+firm encoding decisions that can, indeed, be disputed.  The TEI points
+the publisher in a proper direction but does not presume to make all the
+decisions for him or her.  Essentially, the goal of encoding was to
+eliminate, as much as possible, the hindrances to information-networking,
+so that if an institution acquires a database, everybody associated with
+the institution can have access to it.
+
+CALALUCA demonstrated a portion of Volume 160, because it had the most
+anomalies in it.  The software was created by Electronic Book
+Technologies of Providence, RI, and is called Dynatext.  The software
+works only with SGML-coded data.
+
+Viewing a table of contents on the screen, the audience saw how Dynatext
+treats each element as a book and attempts to simplify movement through a
+volume.  Familiarity with the Patrologia in print (i.e., the text, its
+source, and the editions) will make the machine-readable versions highly
+useful.  (Software with a Windows application was sought for PLD,
+CALALUCA said, because this was the main trend for scholarly use.)
+
+CALALUCA also demonstrated how a user can perform a variety of searches
+and quickly move to any part of a volume; the look-up screen provides
+some basic, simple word-searching. 
+
+CALALUCA argued that one of the major difficulties is not the software. 
+Rather, in creating a product that will be used by scholars representing
+a broad spectrum of computer sophistication,  user documentation proves
+to be the most important service one can provide.
+
+CALALUCA next illustrated a truncated search under mysterium within ten
+words of virtus and how one would be able to find its contents throughout
+the entire database.  He said that the exciting thing about PLD is that
+many of the applications in the retrieval software being written for it
+will exceed the capabilities of the software employed now for the CD-ROM
+version.  The CD-ROM faces genuine limitations, in terms of speed and
+comprehensiveness, in the creation of a retrieval software to run it. 
+CALALUCA said he hoped that individual scholars will download the data,
+if they wish, to their personal computers, and have ready access to
+important texts on a constant basis, which they will be able to use in
+their research and from which they might even be able to publish.
+
+(CALALUCA explained that the blue numbers represented Migne's column numbers,
+which are the standard scholarly references.  Pulling up a note, he stated
+that these texts were heavily edited and the image files would appear simply
+as a note as well, so that one could quickly access an image.)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+A demonstration of American Memory by its coordinator, Carl FLEISCHHAUER,
+and Ricky ERWAY, associate coordinator, Library of Congress, concluded
+the morning session.  Beginning with a collection of broadsides from the
+Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention, the only text
+collection in a presentable form at the time of the Workshop, FLEISCHHAUER
+highlighted several of the problems with which AM is still wrestling.
+(In its final form, the disk will contain two collections, not only the
+broadsides but also the full text with illustrations of a set of
+approximately 300 African-American pamphlets from the period 1870 to 1910.)
+
+As FREEMAN had explained earlier, AM has attempted to use a small amount
+of interpretation to introduce collections.  In the present case, the
+contractor, a company named Quick Source, in Silver Spring, MD., used
+software called Toolbook and put together a modestly interactive
+introduction to the collection.  Like the two preceding speakers,
+FLEISCHHAUER argued that the real asset was the underlying collection.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER proceeded to describe various search and retrieval
+capabilities while ERWAY worked the computer.  In this particular package
+the "go to" pull-down allowed the user in effect to jump out of Toolbook,
+where the interactive program was located, and enter the third-party
+software used by AM for this text collection, which is called Personal
+Librarian.  This was the Windows version of Personal Librarian, a
+software application put together by a company in Rockville, Md.
+
+Since the broadsides came from the Revolutionary War period, a search was
+conducted using the words British or war, with the default operator reset
+as or.  FLEISCHHAUER demonstrated both automatic stemming (which finds
+other forms of the same root) and a truncated search.  One of Personal
+Librarian's strongest features, the relevance ranking, was represented by
+a chart that indicated how often words being sought appeared in
+documents, with the one receiving the most "hits" obtaining the highest
+score.  The "hit list" that is supplied takes the relevance ranking into
+account, making the first hit, in effect, the one the software has
+selected as the most relevant example.
+
+While in the text of one of the broadside documents, FLEISCHHAUER
+remarked AM's attempt to find ways to connect cataloging to the texts,
+which it does in different ways in different manifestations.  In the case
+shown, the cataloging was pasted on:  AM took MARC records that were
+written as on-line records right into one of the Library's mainframe
+retrieval programs, pulled them out, and handed them off to the contractor,
+who massaged them somewhat to display them in the manner shown.  One of
+AM's questions is, Does the cataloguing normally performed in the mainframe
+work in this context, or had AM ought to think through adjustments?
+
+FLEISCHHAUER made the additional point that, as far as the text goes, AM
+has gravitated towards SGML (he pointed to the boldface in the upper part
+of the screen).  Although extremely limited in its ability to translate
+or interpret SGML, Personal Librarian will furnish both bold and italics
+on screen; a fairly easy thing to do, but it is one of the ways in which
+SGML is useful.
+
+Striking a balance between quantity and quality has been a major concern
+of AM, with accuracy being one of the places where project staff have
+felt that less than 100-percent accuracy was not unacceptable. 
+FLEISCHHAUER cited the example of the standard of the rekeying industry,
+namely 99.95 percent; as one service bureau informed him, to go from
+99.95 to 100 percent would double the cost.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER next demonstrated how AM furnishes users recourse to images,
+and at the same time recalled LESK's pointed question concerning the
+number of people who would look at those images and the number who would
+work only with the text.  If the implication of LESK's question was
+sound, FLEISCHHAUER said, it raised the stakes for text accuracy and
+reduced the value of the strategy for images.
+
+Contending that preservation is always a bugaboo, FLEISCHHAUER
+demonstrated several images derived from a scan of a preservation
+microfilm that AM had made.  He awarded a grade of C at best, perhaps a
+C minus or a C plus, for how well it worked out.  Indeed, the matter of
+learning if other people had better ideas about scanning in general, and,
+in particular, scanning from microfilm, was one of the factors that drove
+AM to attempt to think through the agenda for the Workshop.  Skew, for
+example, was one of the issues that AM in its ignorance had not reckoned
+would prove so difficult.
+
+Further, the handling of images of the sort shown, in a desktop computer
+environment, involved a considerable amount of zooming and scrolling. 
+Ultimately, AM staff feel that perhaps the paper copy that is printed out
+might be the most useful one, but they remain uncertain as to how much
+on-screen reading users will do.
+
+Returning to the text, FLEISCHHAUER asked viewers to imagine a person who
+might be conducting a search in a full-text environment.  With this
+scenario, he proceeded to illustrate other features of Personal Librarian
+that he considered helpful; for example, it provides the ability to
+notice words as one reads.  Clicking the "include" button on the bottom
+of the search window pops the words that have been highlighted into the
+search.  Thus, a user can refine the search as he or she reads,
+re-executing the search and continuing to find things in the quest for
+materials.  This software not only contains relevance ranking, Boolean
+operators, and truncation, it also permits one to perform word algebra,
+so to say, where one puts two or three words in parentheses and links
+them with one Boolean operator and then a couple of words in another set
+of parentheses and asks for things within so many words of others.
+
+Until they became acquainted recently with some of the work being done in
+classics, the AM staff had not realized that a large number of the
+projects that involve electronic texts were being done by people with a
+profound interest in language and linguistics.  Their search strategies
+and thinking are oriented to those fields, as is shown in particular by
+the Perseus example.  As amateur historians, the AM staff were thinking
+more of searching for concepts and ideas than for particular words. 
+Obviously, FLEISCHHAUER conceded, searching for concepts and ideas and
+searching for words may be two rather closely related things.
+
+While displaying several images, FLEISCHHAUER observed that the Macintosh
+prototype built by AM contains a greater diversity of formats.  Echoing a
+previous speaker, he said that it was easier to stitch things together in
+the Macintosh, though it tended to be a little more anemic in search and
+retrieval.  AM, therefore, increasingly has been investigating
+sophisticated retrieval engines in the IBM format.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER demonstrated several additional examples of the prototype
+interfaces:  One was AM's metaphor for the network future, in which a
+kind of reading-room graphic suggests how one would be able to go around
+to different materials.  AM contains a large number of photographs in
+analog video form worked up from a videodisc, which enable users to make
+copies to print or incorporate in digital documents.  A frame-grabber is
+built into the system, making it possible to bring an image into a window
+and digitize or print it out.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER next demonstrated sound recording, which included texts. 
+Recycled from a previous project, the collection included sixty 78-rpm
+phonograph records of political speeches that were made during and
+immediately after World War I.  These constituted approximately three
+hours of audio, as AM has digitized it, which occupy 150 megabytes on a
+CD.  Thus, they are considerably compressed.  From the catalogue card,
+FLEISCHHAUER proceeded to a transcript of a speech with the audio
+available and with highlighted text following it as it played.
+A photograph has been added and a transcription made.
+
+Considerable value has been added beyond what the Library of Congress
+normally would do in cataloguing a sound recording, which raises several
+questions for AM concerning where to draw lines about how much value it can
+afford to add and at what point, perhaps, this becomes more than AM could
+reasonably do or reasonably wish to do.  FLEISCHHAUER also demonstrated
+a motion picture.  As FREEMAN had reported earlier, the motion picture
+materials have proved the most popular, not surprisingly.  This says more
+about the medium, he thought, than about AM's presentation of it.
+
+Because AM's goal was to bring together things that could be used by
+historians or by people who were curious about history,
+turn-of-the-century footage seemed to represent the most appropriate
+collections from the Library of Congress in motion pictures. These were
+the very first films made by Thomas Edison's company and some others at
+that time.  The particular example illustrated was a Biograph film,
+brought in with a frame-grabber into a window.  A single videodisc
+contains about fifty titles and pieces of film from that period, all of
+New York City.  Taken together, AM believes, they provide an interesting
+documentary resource.
+

+DISCUSSION * Using the frame-grabber in AM * Volume of material processed
+and to be processed * Purpose of AM within LC * Cataloguing and the
+nature of AM's material * SGML coding and the question of quality versus
+quantity *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+During the question-and-answer period that followed FLEISCHHAUER's
+presentation, several clarifications were made.
+
+AM is bringing in motion pictures from a videodisc.  The frame-grabber
+devices create a window on a computer screen, which permits users to
+digitize a single frame of the movie or one of the photographs.  It
+produces a crude, rough-and-ready image that high school students can
+incorporate into papers, and that has worked very nicely in this way.
+
+Commenting on FLEISCHHAUER's assertion that AM was looking more at
+searching ideas than words, MYLONAS argued that without words an idea
+does not exist.  FLEISCHHAUER conceded that he ought to have articulated
+his point more clearly.  MYLONAS stated that they were in fact both
+talking about the same thing.  By searching for words and by forcing
+people to focus on the word, the Perseus Project felt that they would get
+them to the idea.  The way one reviews results is tailored more to one
+kind of user than another.
+
+Concerning the total volume of material that has been processed in this
+way, AM at this point has in retrievable form seven or eight collections,
+all of them photographic.  In the Macintosh environment, for example,
+there probably are 35,000-40,000 photographs.  The sound recordings
+number sixty items.  The broadsides number about 300 items.  There are
+500 political cartoons in the form of drawings.  The motion pictures, as
+individual items, number sixty to seventy.
+
+AM also has a manuscript collection, the life history portion of one of
+the federal project series, which will contain 2,900 individual
+documents, all first-person narratives.  AM has in process about 350
+African-American pamphlets, or about 12,000 printed pages for the period
+1870-1910.  Also in the works are some 4,000 panoramic photographs.  AM
+has recycled a fair amount of the work done by LC's Prints and
+Photographs Division during the Library's optical disk pilot project in
+the 1980s.  For example, a special division of LC has tooled up and
+thought through all the ramifications of electronic presentation of
+photographs.  Indeed, they are wheeling them out in great barrel loads. 
+The purpose of AM within the Library, it is hoped, is to catalyze several
+of the other special collection divisions which have no particular
+experience with, in some cases, mixed feelings about, an activity such as
+AM.  Moreover, in many cases the divisions may be characterized as not
+only lacking experience in "electronifying" things but also in automated
+cataloguing.  MARC cataloguing as practiced in the United States is
+heavily weighted toward the description of monograph and serial
+materials, but is much thinner when one enters the world of manuscripts
+and things that are held in the Library's music collection and other
+units.  In response to a comment by LESK, that AM's material is very
+heavily photographic, and is so primarily because individual records have
+been made for each photograph, FLEISCHHAUER observed that an item-level
+catalog record exists, for example, for each photograph in the Detroit
+Publishing collection of 25,000 pictures.  In the case of the Federal
+Writers Project, for which nearly 3,000 documents exist, representing
+information from twenty-six different states, AM with the assistance of
+Karen STUART of the Manuscript Division will attempt to find some way not
+only to have a collection-level record but perhaps a MARC record for each
+state, which will then serve as an umbrella for the 100-200 documents
+that come under it.  But that drama remains to be enacted.  The AM staff
+is conservative and clings to cataloguing, though of course visitors tout
+artificial intelligence and neural networks in a manner that suggests that
+perhaps one need not have cataloguing or that much of it could be put aside.
+
+The matter of SGML coding, FLEISCHHAUER conceded, returned the discussion
+to the earlier treated question of quality versus quantity in the Library
+of Congress.  Of course, text conversion can be done with 100-percent
+accuracy, but it means that when one's holdings are as vast as LC's only
+a tiny amount will be exposed, whereas permitting lower levels of
+accuracy can lead to exposing or sharing larger amounts, but with the
+quality correspondingly impaired.

+TWOHIG * A contrary experience concerning electronic options * Volume of
+material in the Washington papers and a suggestion of David Packard *
+Implications of Packard's suggestion * Transcribing the documents for the
+CD-ROM * Accuracy of transcriptions * The CD-ROM edition of the Founding
+Fathers documents *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Finding encouragement in a comment of MICHELSON's from the morning
+session--that numerous people in the humanities were choosing electronic
+options to do their work--Dorothy TWOHIG, editor, The Papers of George
+Washington, opened her illustrated talk by noting that her experience
+with literary scholars and numerous people in editing was contrary to
+MICHELSON's.  TWOHIG emphasized literary scholars' complete ignorance of
+the technological options available to them or their reluctance or, in
+some cases, their downright hostility toward these options.
+
+After providing an overview of the five Founding Fathers projects
+(Jefferson at Princeton, Franklin at Yale, John Adams at the
+Massachusetts Historical Society, and Madison down the hall from her at
+the University of Virginia), TWOHIG observed that the Washington papers,
+like all of the projects, include both sides of the Washington
+correspondence and deal with some 135,000 documents to be published with
+extensive annotation in eighty to eighty-five volumes, a project that
+will not be completed until well into the next century.  Thus, it was
+with considerable enthusiasm several years ago that the Washington Papers
+Project (WPP) greeted David Packard's suggestion that the papers of the
+Founding Fathers could be published easily and inexpensively, and to the
+great benefit of American scholarship, via CD-ROM.
+
+In pragmatic terms, funding from the Packard Foundation would expedite
+the transcription of thousands of documents waiting to be put on disk in
+the WPP offices.  Further, since the costs of collecting, editing, and
+converting the Founding Fathers documents into letterpress editions were
+running into the millions of dollars, and the considerable staffs
+involved in all of these projects were devoting their careers to
+producing the work, the Packard Foundation's suggestion had a
+revolutionary aspect:  Transcriptions of the entire corpus of the
+Founding Fathers papers would be available on CD-ROM to public and
+college libraries, even high schools, at a fraction of the cost--
+$100-$150 for the annual license fee--to produce a limited university
+press run of 1,000 of each volume of the published papers at $45-$150 per
+printed volume.  Given the current budget crunch in educational systems
+and the corresponding constraints on librarians in smaller institutions
+who wish to add these volumes to their collections, producing the
+documents on CD-ROM would likely open a greatly expanded audience for the
+papers.  TWOHIG stressed, however, that development of the Founding
+Fathers CD-ROM is still in its infancy.  Serious software problems remain
+to be resolved before the material can be put into readable form.  
+
+Funding from the Packard Foundation resulted in a major push to
+transcribe the 75,000 or so documents of the Washington papers remaining
+to be transcribed onto computer disks.  Slides illustrated several of the
+problems encountered, for example, the present inability of CD-ROM to
+indicate the cross-outs (deleted material) in eighteenth century
+documents.  TWOHIG next described documents from various periods in the
+eighteenth century that have been transcribed in chronological order and
+delivered to the Packard offices in California, where they are converted
+to the CD-ROM, a process that is expected to consume five years to
+complete (that is, reckoning from David Packard's suggestion made several
+years ago, until about July 1994).  TWOHIG found an encouraging
+indication of the project's benefits in the ongoing use made by scholars
+of the search functions of the CD-ROM, particularly in reducing the time
+spent in manually turning the pages of the Washington papers.
+
+TWOHIG next furnished details concerning the accuracy of transcriptions. 
+For instance, the insertion of thousands of documents on the CD-ROM
+currently does not permit each document to be verified against the
+original manuscript several times as in the case of documents that appear
+in the published edition.  However, the transcriptions receive a cursory
+check for obvious typos, the misspellings of proper names, and other
+errors from the WPP CD-ROM editor.  Eventually, all documents that appear
+in the electronic version will be checked by project editors.  Although
+this process has met with opposition from some of the editors on the
+grounds that imperfect work may leave their offices, the advantages in
+making this material available as a research tool outweigh  fears about the
+misspelling of proper names and other relatively minor editorial matters.
+
+Completion of all five Founding Fathers projects (i.e., retrievability
+and searchability of all of the documents by proper names, alternate
+spellings, or varieties of subjects) will provide one of the richest
+sources of this size for the history of the United States in the latter
+part of the eighteenth century.  Further, publication on CD-ROM will
+allow editors to include even minutiae, such as laundry lists, not
+included in the printed volumes.
+
+It seems possible that the extensive annotation provided in the printed
+volumes eventually will be added to the CD-ROM edition, pending
+negotiations with the publishers of the papers.  At the moment, the
+Founding Fathers CD-ROM is accessible only on the IBYCUS, a computer
+developed out of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project and designed for
+the use of classical scholars.  There are perhaps 400 IBYCUS computers in
+the country, most of which are in university classics departments. 
+Ultimately, it is anticipated that the CD-ROM edition of the Founding
+Fathers documents will run on any IBM-compatible or Macintosh computer
+with a CD-ROM drive.  Numerous changes in the software will also occur
+before the project is completed.  (Editor's note: an IBYCUS was
+unavailable to demonstrate the CD-ROM.)

+DISCUSSION * Several additional features of WPP clarified *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Discussion following TWOHIG's presentation served to clarify several
+additional features, including (1) that the project's primary
+intellectual product consists in the electronic transcription of the
+material; (2) that the text transmitted to the CD-ROM people is not
+marked up; (3) that cataloging and subject-indexing of the material
+remain to be worked out (though at this point material can be retrieved
+by name); and (4) that because all the searching is done in the hardware,
+the IBYCUS is designed to read a CD-ROM which contains only sequential
+text files.  Technically, it then becomes very easy to read the material
+off and put it on another device.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Maria LEBRON, managing editor, The Online Journal of Current Clinical
+Trials (OJCCT), presented an illustrated overview of the history of the
+joint project between the American Association for the Advancement of
+Science (AAAS) and the Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC).  The
+joint venture between AAAS and OCLC owes its beginning to a
+reorganization launched by the new chief executive officer at OCLC about
+three years ago and combines the strengths of these two disparate
+organizations.  In short, OJCCT represents the process of scholarly
+publishing on line.
+
+LEBRON next discussed several practices the on-line environment shares
+with traditional publishing on hard copy--for example, peer review of
+manuscripts--that are highly important in the academic world.  LEBRON
+noted in particular the implications of citation counts for tenure
+committees and grants committees.  In the traditional hard-copy
+environment, citation counts are readily demonstrable, whereas the
+on-line environment represents an ethereal medium to most academics.
+
+LEBRON remarked several technical and behavioral barriers to electronic
+publishing, for instance, the problems in transmission created by special
+characters or by complex graphics and halftones.  In addition, she noted
+economic limitations such as the storage costs of maintaining back issues
+and market or audience education.
+
+Manuscripts cannot be uploaded to OJCCT, LEBRON explained, because it is
+not a bulletin board or E-mail, forms of electronic transmission of
+information that have created an ambience clouding people's understanding
+of what the journal is attempting to do.  OJCCT, which publishes
+peer-reviewed medical articles dealing with the subject of clinical
+trials, includes text, tabular material, and graphics, although at this
+time it can transmit only line illustrations.
+
+Next, LEBRON described how AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of
+clinical trials:  It is 1) a highly statistical discipline that 2) does
+not require halftones but can satisfy the needs of its audience with line
+illustrations and graphic material, and 3) there is a need for the speedy
+dissemination of high-quality research results.  Clinical trials are
+research activities that involve the administration of a test treatment
+to some experimental unit in order to test its usefulness before it is
+made available to the general population.  LEBRON proceeded to give
+additional information on OJCCT concerning its editor-in-chief, editorial
+board, editorial content, and the types of articles it publishes
+(including peer-reviewed research reports and reviews), as well as
+features shared by other traditional hard-copy journals.
+
+Among the advantages of the electronic format are faster dissemination of
+information, including raw data, and the absence of space constraints
+because pages do not exist.  (This latter fact creates an interesting
+situation when it comes to citations.)  Nor are there any issues.  AAAS's
+capacity to download materials directly from the journal to a
+subscriber's printer, hard drive, or floppy disk helps ensure highly
+accurate transcription.  Other features of OJCCT include on-screen alerts
+that allow linkage of subsequently published documents to the original
+documents; on-line searching by subject, author, title, etc.; indexing of
+every single word that appears in an article; viewing access to an
+article by component (abstract, full text, or graphs); numbered
+paragraphs to replace page counts; publication in Science every thirty
+days of indexing of all articles published in the journal;
+typeset-quality screens; and Hypertext links that enable subscribers to
+bring up Medline abstracts directly without leaving the journal.
+
+After detailing the two primary ways to gain access to the journal,
+through the OCLC network and Compuserv if one desires graphics or through
+the Internet if just an ASCII file is desired, LEBRON illustrated the
+speedy editorial process and the coding of the document using SGML tags
+after it has been accepted for publication.  She also gave an illustrated
+tour of the journal, its search-and-retrieval capabilities in particular,
+but also including problems associated with scanning in illustrations,
+and the importance of on-screen alerts to the medical profession re
+retractions or corrections, or more frequently, editorials, letters to
+the editors, or follow-up reports.  She closed by inviting the audience
+to join AAAS on 1 July, when OJCCT was scheduled to go on-line.
+
+                                 ******
+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+DISCUSSION * Additional features of OJCCT *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+In the lengthy discussion that followed LEBRON's presentation, these
+points emerged:
+
+     * The SGML text can be tailored as users wish.
+
+     * All these articles have a fairly simple document definition.
+
+     * Document-type definitions (DTDs) were developed and given to OJCCT
+     for coding.
+
+     * No articles will be removed from the journal.  (Because there are
+     no back issues, there are no lost issues either.  Once a subscriber
+     logs onto the journal he or she has access not only to the currently
+     published materials, but retrospectively to everything that has been
+     published in it.  Thus the table of contents grows bigger.  The date
+     of publication serves to distinguish between currently published
+     materials and older materials.)
+
+     * The pricing system for the journal resembles that for most medical
+     journals:  for 1992, $95 for a year, plus telecommunications charges
+     (there are no connect time charges);    for 1993, $110 for the
+     entire year for single users, though the journal can be put on a
+     local area network (LAN).  However, only one person can access the
+     journal at a time.  Site licenses may come in the future.
+
+     * AAAS is working closely with colleagues at OCLC to display
+     mathematical equations on screen.
+
+     * Without compromising any steps in the editorial process, the
+     technology has reduced the time lag between when a manuscript is
+     originally submitted and the time it is accepted; the review process
+     does not differ greatly from the standard six-to-eight weeks
+     employed by many of the hard-copy journals.  The process still
+     depends on people.
+
+     * As far as a preservation copy is concerned, articles will be
+     maintained on the computer permanently and subscribers, as part of
+     their subscription, will receive a microfiche-quality archival copy
+     of everything published during that year; in addition, reprints can
+     be purchased in much the same way as in a hard-copy environment. 
+     Hard copies are prepared but are not the primary medium for the
+     dissemination of the information.
+
+     * Because OJCCT is not yet on line, it is difficult to know how many
+     people would simply browse through the journal on the screen as
+     opposed to downloading the whole thing and printing it out; a mix of
+     both types of users likely will result.
+
+                                 ******

+Project * Advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project *
+Developing a network application an underlying assumption of the project
+* Details of the scanning process * Print-on-demand copies of books *
+Future plans include development of a browsing tool *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Lynne PERSONIUS, assistant director, Cornell Information Technologies for
+Scholarly Information Services, Cornell University, first commented on
+the tremendous impact that developments in technology over the past ten
+years--networking, in particular--have had on the way information is
+handled, and how, in her own case, these developments have counterbalanced
+Cornell's relative geographical isolation.  Other significant technologies
+include scanners, which are much more sophisticated than they were ten years
+ago; mass storage and the dramatic savings that result from it in terms of
+both space and money relative to twenty or thirty years ago; new and
+improved printing technologies, which have greatly affected the distribution
+of information; and, of course, digital technologies, whose applicability to
+library preservation remains at issue.
+
+Given that context, PERSONIUS described the College Library Access and
+Storage System (CLASS) Project, a library preservation project,
+primarily, and what has been accomplished.  Directly funded by the
+Commission on Preservation and Access and by the Xerox Corporation, which
+has provided a significant amount of hardware, the CLASS Project has been
+working with a development team at Xerox to develop a software
+application tailored to library preservation requirements.  Within
+Cornell, participants in the project have been working jointly with both
+library and information technologies.  The focus of the project has been
+on reformatting and saving books that are in brittle condition. 
+PERSONIUS showed Workshop participants a brittle book, and described how
+such books were the result of developments in papermaking around the
+beginning of the Industrial Revolution.  The papermaking process was
+changed so that a significant amount of acid was introduced into the
+actual paper itself, which deteriorates as it sits on library shelves.
+
+One of the advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project is that
+the information in brittle books is mostly out of copyright and thus
+offers an opportunity to work with material that requires library
+preservation, and to create and work on an infrastructure to save the
+material.  Acknowledging the familiarity of those working in preservation
+with this information, PERSONIUS noted that several things are being
+done:  the primary preservation technology used today is photocopying of
+brittle material.  Saving the intellectual content of the material is the
+main goal.  With microfilm copy, the intellectual content is preserved on
+the assumption that in the future the image can be reformatted in any
+other way that then exists.
+
+An underlying assumption of the CLASS Project from the beginning was
+that it would develop a network application.  Project staff scan books
+at a workstation located in the library, near the brittle material.
+An image-server filing system is located at a distance from that
+workstation, and a printer is located in another building.  All of the
+materials digitized and stored on the image-filing system are cataloged
+in the on-line catalogue.  In fact, a record for each of these electronic
+books is stored in the RLIN database so that a record exists of what is
+in the digital library throughout standard catalogue procedures.  In the
+future, researchers working from their own workstations in their offices,
+or their networks, will have access--wherever they might be--through a
+request server being built into the new digital library.  A second
+assumption is that the preferred means of finding the material will be by
+looking through a catalogue.  PERSONIUS described the scanning process,
+which uses a prototype scanner being developed by Xerox and which scans a
+very high resolution image at great speed.  Another significant feature,
+because this is a preservation application, is the placing of the pages
+that fall apart one for one on the platen.  Ordinarily, a scanner could
+be used with some sort of a document feeder, but because of this
+application that is not feasible.  Further, because CLASS is a
+preservation application, after the paper replacement is made there, a
+very careful quality control check is performed.  An original book is
+compared to the printed copy and verification is made, before proceeding,
+that all of the image, all of the information, has been captured.  Then,
+a new library book is produced:  The printed images are rebound by a
+commercial binder and a new book is returned to the shelf. 
+Significantly, the books returned to the library shelves are beautiful
+and useful replacements on acid-free paper that should last a long time,
+in effect, the equivalent of preservation photocopies.  Thus, the project
+has a library of digital books.  In essence, CLASS is scanning and
+storing books as 600 dot-per-inch bit-mapped images, compressed using
+Group 4 CCITT (i.e., the French acronym for International Consultative
+Committee for Telegraph and Telephone) compression.  They are stored as
+TIFF files on an optical filing system that is composed of a database
+used for searching and locating the books and an optical jukebox that
+stores 64 twelve-inch platters.  A very-high-resolution printed copy of
+these books at 600 dots per inch is created, using a Xerox DocuTech
+printer to make the paper replacements on acid-free paper.
+
+PERSONIUS maintained that the CLASS Project presents an opportunity to
+introduce people to books as digital images by using a paper medium. 
+Books are returned to the shelves while people are also given the ability
+to print on demand--to make their own copies of books.  (PERSONIUS
+distributed copies of an engineering journal published by engineering
+students at Cornell around 1900 as an example of what a print-on-demand
+copy of material might be like.  This very cheap copy would be available
+to people to use for their own research purposes and would bridge the gap
+between an electronic work and the paper that readers like to have.) 
+PERSONIUS then attempted to illustrate a very early prototype of
+networked access to this digital library.  Xerox Corporation has
+developed a prototype of a view station that can send images across the
+network to be viewed.
+
+The particular library brought down for demonstration contained two
+mathematics books.  CLASS is developing and will spend the next year
+developing an application that allows people at workstations to browse
+the books.  Thus, CLASS is developing a browsing tool, on the assumption
+that users do not want to read an entire book from a workstation, but
+would prefer to be able to look through and decide if they would like to
+have a printed copy of it.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+DISCUSSION * Re retrieval software * "Digital file copyright" * Scanning
+rate during production * Autosegmentation * Criteria employed in
+selecting books for scanning * Compression and decompression of images *
+OCR not precluded *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+During the question-and-answer period that followed her presentation,
+PERSONIUS made these additional points:
+
+     * Re retrieval software, Cornell is developing a Unix-based server
+     as well as clients for the server that support multiple platforms
+     (Macintosh, IBM and Sun workstations), in the hope that people from
+     any of those platforms will retrieve books; a further operating
+     assumption is that standard interfaces will be used as much as
+     possible, where standards can be put in place, because CLASS
+     considers this retrieval software a library application and would
+     like to be able to look at material not only at Cornell but at other
+     institutions.
+
+     * The phrase "digital file copyright by Cornell University" was
+     added at the advice of Cornell's legal staff with the caveat that it
+     probably would not hold up in court.  Cornell does not want people
+     to copy its books and sell them but would like to keep them
+     available for use in a library environment for library purposes.
+
+     * In production the scanner can scan about 300 pages per hour,
+     capturing 600 dots per inch.
+
+     * The Xerox software has filters to scan halftone material and avoid
+     the moire patterns that occur when halftone material is scanned. 
+     Xerox has been working on hardware and software that would enable
+     the scanner itself to recognize this situation and deal with it
+     appropriately--a kind of autosegmentation that would enable the
+     scanner to handle halftone material as well as text on a single page.
+
+     * The books subjected to the elaborate process described above were
+     selected because CLASS is a preservation project, with the first 500
+     books selected coming from Cornell's mathematics collection, because
+     they were still being heavily used and because, although they were
+     in need of preservation, the mathematics library and the mathematics
+     faculty were uncomfortable having them microfilmed.  (They wanted a
+     printed copy.)  Thus, these books became a logical choice for this
+     project.  Other books were chosen by the project's selection committees
+     for experiments with the technology, as well as to meet a demand or need.
+
+     * Images will be decompressed before they are sent over the line; at
+     this time they are compressed and sent to the image filing system
+     and then sent to the printer as compressed images; they are returned
+     to the workstation as compressed 600-dpi images and the workstation
+     decompresses and scales them for display--an inefficient way to
+     access the material though it works quite well for printing and
+     other purposes.
+
+     * CLASS is also decompressing on Macintosh and IBM, a slow process
+     right now.  Eventually, compression and decompression will take
+     place on an image conversion server.  Trade-offs will be made, based
+     on future performance testing, concerning where the file is
+     compressed and what resolution image is sent.
+
+     * OCR has not been precluded; images are being stored that have been
+     scanned at a high resolution, which presumably would suit them well
+     to an OCR process.  Because the material being scanned is about 100
+     years old and was printed with less-than-ideal technologies, very
+     early and preliminary tests have not produced good results.  But the
+     project is capturing an image that is of sufficient resolution to be
+     subjected to OCR in the future.  Moreover, the system architecture
+     and the system plan have a logical place to store an OCR image if it
+     has been captured.  But that is not being done now.
+
+                                 ******
+
+SESSION III.  DISTRIBUTION, NETWORKS, AND NETWORKING:  OPTIONS FOR
+DISSEMINATION
+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ZICH * Issues pertaining to CD-ROMs * Options for publishing in CD-ROM *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Robert ZICH, special assistant to the associate librarian for special
+projects, Library of Congress, and moderator of this session, first noted
+the blessed but somewhat awkward circumstance of having four very
+distinguished people representing networks and networking or at least
+leaning in that direction, while lacking anyone to speak from the
+strongest possible background in CD-ROMs.  ZICH expressed the hope that
+members of the audience would join the discussion.  He stressed the
+subtitle of this particular session, "Options for Dissemination," and,
+concerning CD-ROMs, the importance of determining when it would be wise
+to consider dissemination in CD-ROM versus networks.  A shopping list of
+issues pertaining to CD-ROMs included:  the grounds for selecting
+commercial publishers, and in-house publication where possible versus
+nonprofit or government publication.  A similar list for networks
+included:  determining when one should consider dissemination through a
+network, identifying the mechanisms or entities that exist to place items
+on networks, identifying the pool of existing networks, determining how a
+producer  would choose between networks, and identifying the elements of
+a business arrangement in a network.
+
+Options for publishing in CD-ROM:  an outside publisher versus
+self-publication.  If an outside publisher is used, it can be nonprofit,
+such as the Government Printing Office (GPO) or the National Technical
+Information Service (NTIS), in the case of government.  The pros and cons
+associated with employing an outside publisher are obvious.  Among the
+pros, there is no trouble getting accepted.  One pays the bill and, in
+effect, goes one's way.  Among the cons, when one pays an outside
+publisher to perform the work, that publisher will perform the work it is
+obliged to do, but perhaps without the production expertise and skill in
+marketing and dissemination that some would seek.  There is the body of
+commercial publishers that do possess that kind of expertise in
+distribution and marketing but that obviously are selective.  In
+self-publication, one exercises full control, but then one must handle
+matters such as distribution and marketing.  Such are some of the options
+for publishing in the case of CD-ROM.
+
+In the case of technical and design issues, which are also important,
+there are many matters which many at the Workshop already knew a good
+deal about:  retrieval system requirements and costs, what to do about
+images, the various capabilities and platforms, the trade-offs between
+cost and performance, concerns about local-area networkability,
+interoperability, etc.

+computing in the academic world * Recommendations for producing multimedia
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Clifford LYNCH, director, Library Automation, University of California,
+opened his talk with the general observation that networked information
+constituted a difficult and elusive topic because it is something just
+starting to develop and not yet fully understood.  LYNCH contended that
+creating genuinely networked information was different from using
+networks as an access or dissemination vehicle and was more sophisticated
+and more subtle.  He invited the members of the audience to extrapolate,
+from what they heard about the preceding demonstration projects, to what
+sort of a world of electronics information--scholarly, archival,
+cultural, etc.--they wished to end up with ten or fifteen years from now. 
+LYNCH suggested that to extrapolate directly from these projects would
+produce unpleasant results.
+
+Putting the issue of CD-ROM in perspective before getting into
+generalities on networked information, LYNCH observed that those engaged
+in multimedia today who wish to ship a product, so to say, probably do
+not have much choice except to use CD-ROM:  networked multimedia on a
+large scale basically does not yet work because the technology does not
+exist.  For example, anybody who has tried moving images around over the
+Internet knows that this is an exciting touch-and-go process, a
+fascinating and fertile area for experimentation, research, and
+development, but not something that one can become deeply enthusiastic
+about committing to production systems at this time.
+
+This situation will change, LYNCH said.  He differentiated CD-ROM from
+the practices that have been followed up to now in distributing data on
+CD-ROM.  For LYNCH the problem with CD-ROM is not its portability or its
+slowness but the two-edged sword of having the retrieval application and
+the user interface inextricably bound up with the data, which is the
+typical CD-ROM publication model.  It is not a case of publishing data
+but of distributing a typically stand-alone, typically closed system,
+all--software, user interface, and data--on a little disk.  Hence, all
+the between-disk navigational issues as well as the impossibility in most
+cases of integrating data on one disk with that on another.  Most CD-ROM
+retrieval software does not network very gracefully at present.  However,
+in the present world of immature standards and lack of understanding of
+what network information is or what the ground rules are for creating or
+using it, publishing information on a CD-ROM does add value in a very
+real sense.
+
+LYNCH drew a contrast between CD-ROM and network pricing and in doing so
+highlighted something bizarre in information pricing.  A large
+institution such as the University of California has vendors who will
+offer to sell information on CD-ROM for a price per year in four digits,
+but for the same data (e.g., an abstracting and indexing database) on
+magnetic tape, regardless of how many people may use it concurrently,
+will quote a price in six digits.
+
+What is packaged with the CD-ROM in one sense adds value--a complete
+access system, not just raw, unrefined information--although it is not
+generally perceived that way.  This is because the access software,
+although it adds value, is viewed by some people, particularly in the
+university environment where there is a very heavy commitment to
+networking, as being developed in the wrong direction.
+
+Given that context, LYNCH described the examples demonstrated as a set of
+insular information gems--Perseus, for example, offers nicely linked
+information, but would be very difficult to integrate with other
+databases, that is, to link together seamlessly with other source files
+from other sources.  It resembles an island, and in this respect is
+similar to numerous stand-alone projects that are based on videodiscs,
+that is, on the single-workstation concept.
+
+As scholarship evolves in a network environment, the paramount need will
+be to link databases.  We must link personal databases to public
+databases, to group databases, in fairly seamless ways--which is
+extremely difficult in the environments under discussion with copies of
+databases proliferating all over the place.
+
+The notion of layering also struck LYNCH as lurking in several of the
+projects demonstrated.  Several databases in a sense constitute
+information archives without a significant amount of navigation built in. 
+Educators, critics, and others will want a layered structure--one that
+defines or links paths through the layers to allow users to reach
+specific points.  In LYNCH's view, layering will become increasingly
+necessary, and not just within a single resource but across resources
+(e.g., tracing mythology and cultural themes across several classics
+databases as well as a database of Renaissance culture).  This ability to
+organize resources, to build things out of multiple other things on the
+network or select pieces of it, represented for LYNCH one of the key
+aspects of network information.
+
+Contending that information reuse constituted another significant issue,
+LYNCH commended to the audience's attention Project NEEDS (i.e., National
+Engineering Education Delivery System).  This project's objective is to
+produce a database of engineering courseware as well as the components
+that can be used to develop new courseware.  In a number of the existing
+applications, LYNCH said, the issue of reuse (how much one can take apart
+and reuse in other applications) was not being well considered.  He also
+raised the issue of active versus passive use, one aspect of which  is
+how much information will be manipulated locally by users.  Most people,
+he argued, may do a little browsing and then will wish to print.  LYNCH
+was uncertain how these resources would be used by the vast majority of
+users in the network environment.
+
+LYNCH next said a few words about X-Windows as a way of differentiating
+between network access and networked information.  A number of the
+applications demonstrated at the Workshop could be rewritten to use X
+across the network, so that one could run them from any X-capable device-
+-a workstation, an X terminal--and transact with a database across the
+network.  Although this opens up access a little, assuming one has enough
+network to handle it, it does not provide an interface to develop a
+program that conveniently integrates information from multiple databases. 
+X is a viewing technology that has limits.  In a real sense, it is just a
+graphical version of remote log-in across the network.  X-type applications
+represent only one step in the progression towards real access.
+
+LYNCH next discussed barriers to the distribution of networked multimedia
+information.  The heart of the problem is a lack of standards to provide
+the ability for computers to talk to each other, retrieve information,
+and shuffle it around fairly casually.  At the moment, little progress is
+being made on standards for networked information; for example, present
+standards do not cover images, digital voice, and digital video.  A
+useful tool kit of exchange formats for basic texts is only now being
+assembled.  The synchronization of content streams (i.e., synchronizing a
+voice track to a video track, establishing temporal relations between
+different components in a multimedia object) constitutes another issue
+for networked multimedia that is just beginning to receive attention.
+
+Underlying network protocols also need some work; good, real-time
+delivery protocols on the Internet do not yet exist.  In LYNCH's view,
+highly important in this context is the notion of networked digital
+object IDs, the ability of one object on the network to point to another
+object (or component thereof) on the network.  Serious bandwidth issues
+also exist.  LYNCH was uncertain if billion-bit-per-second networks would
+prove sufficient if numerous people ran video in parallel.
+
+LYNCH concluded by offering an issue for database creators to consider,
+as well as several comments about what might constitute good trial
+multimedia experiments.  In a networked information world the database
+builder or service builder (publisher) does not exercise the same
+extensive control over the integrity of the presentation; strange
+programs "munge" with one's data before the user sees it.  Serious
+thought must be given to what guarantees integrity of presentation.  Part
+of that is related to where one draws the boundaries around a networked
+information service.  This question of presentation integrity in
+client-server computing has not been stressed enough in the academic
+world, LYNCH argued, though commercial service providers deal with it
+regularly.
+
+Concerning multimedia, LYNCH observed that good multimedia at the moment
+is hideously expensive to produce.  He recommended producing multimedia
+with either very high sale value, or multimedia with a very long life
+span, or multimedia that will have a very broad usage base and whose
+costs therefore can be amortized among large numbers of users.  In this
+connection, historical and humanistically oriented material may be a good
+place to start, because it tends to have a longer life span than much of
+the scientific material, as well as a wider user base.  LYNCH noted, for
+example, that American Memory fits many of the criteria outlined.  He
+remarked the extensive discussion about bringing the Internet or the
+National Research and Education Network (NREN) into the K-12 environment
+as a way of helping the American educational system.
+
+LYNCH closed by noting that the kinds of applications demonstrated struck
+him as excellent justifications of broad-scale networking for K-12, but
+that at this time no "killer" application exists to mobilize the K-12
+community to obtain connectivity.

+DISCUSSION * Dearth of genuinely interesting applications on the network
+a slow-changing situation * The issue of the integrity of presentation in
+a networked environment * Several reasons why CD-ROM software does not
+network *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+During the discussion period that followed LYNCH's presentation, several
+additional points were made.
+
+LYNCH reiterated even more strongly his contention that, historically,
+once one goes outside high-end science and the group of those who need
+access to supercomputers, there is a great dearth of genuinely
+interesting applications on the network.  He saw this situation changing
+slowly, with some of the scientific databases and scholarly discussion
+groups and electronic journals coming on as well as with the availability
+of Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS) and some of the databases that
+are being mounted there.  However, many of those things do not seem to
+have piqued great popular interest.  For instance, most high school
+students of LYNCH's acquaintance would not qualify as devotees of serious
+molecular biology.
+
+Concerning the issue of the integrity of presentation, LYNCH believed
+that a couple of information providers have laid down the law at least on
+certain things.  For example, his recollection was that the National
+Library of Medicine feels strongly that one needs to employ the
+identifier field if he or she is to mount a database commercially.  The
+problem with a real networked environment is that one does not know who
+is reformatting and reprocessing one's data when one enters a client
+server mode.  It becomes anybody's guess, for example, if the network
+uses a Z39.50 server, or what clients are doing with one's data.  A data
+provider can say that his contract will only permit clients to have
+access to his data after he vets them and their presentation and makes
+certain it suits him.  But LYNCH held out little expectation that the
+network marketplace would evolve in that way, because it required too
+much prior negotiation.
+
+CD-ROM software does not network for a variety of reasons, LYNCH said. 
+He speculated that CD-ROM publishers are not eager to have their products
+really hook into wide area networks, because they fear it will make their
+data suppliers nervous.  Moreover, until relatively recently, one had to
+be rather adroit to run a full TCP/IP stack plus applications on a
+PC-size machine, whereas nowadays it is becoming easier as PCs grow
+bigger and faster.  LYNCH also speculated that software providers had not
+heard from their customers until the last year or so, or had not heard
+from enough of their customers.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Howard BESSER, School of Library and Information Science, University of
+Pittsburgh, spoke primarily about multimedia, focusing on images and the
+broad implications of disseminating them on the network.  He argued that
+planning the distribution of multimedia documents posed two critical
+implementation problems, which he framed in the form of two questions: 
+1) What platform will one use and what hardware and software will users
+have for viewing of the material?  and 2) How can one deliver a
+sufficiently robust set of information in an accessible format in a
+reasonable amount of time?  Depending on whether network or CD-ROM is the
+medium used, this question raises different issues of storage,
+compression, and transmission.
+
+Concerning the design of platforms (e.g., sound, gray scale, simple
+color, etc.) and the various capabilities users may have, BESSER
+maintained that a layered approach was the way to deal with users'
+capabilities.  A result would be that users with less powerful
+workstations would simply have less functionality.  He urged members of
+the audience to advocate standards and accompanying software that handle
+layered functionality across a wide variety of platforms.
+
+BESSER also addressed problems in platform design, namely, deciding how
+large a machine to design for situations when the largest number of users
+have the lowest level of the machine, and one desires higher
+functionality.  BESSER then proceeded to the question of file size and
+its implications for networking.  He discussed still images in the main. 
+For example, a digital color image that fills the screen of a standard
+mega-pel workstation (Sun or Next) will require one megabyte of storage
+for an eight-bit image or three megabytes of storage for a true color or
+twenty-four-bit image.  Lossless compression algorithms (that is,
+computational procedures in which no data is lost in the process of
+compressing [and decompressing] an image--the exact bit-representation is
+maintained) might bring storage down to a third of a megabyte per image,
+but not much further than that.  The question of size makes it difficult
+to fit an appropriately sized set of these images on a single disk or to
+transmit them quickly enough on a network.
+
+With these full screen mega-pel images that constitute a third of a
+megabyte, one gets 1,000-3,000 full-screen images on a one-gigabyte disk;
+a standard CD-ROM represents approximately 60 percent of that.  Storing
+images the size of a PC screen (just 8 bit color) increases storage
+capacity to 4,000-12,000 images per gigabyte; 60 percent of that gives
+one the size of a CD-ROM, which in turn creates a major problem.  One
+cannot have full-screen, full-color images with lossless compression; one
+must compress them or use a lower resolution.  For megabyte-size images,
+anything slower than a T-1 speed is impractical.  For example, on a
+fifty-six-kilobaud line, it takes three minutes to transfer a
+one-megabyte file, if it is not compressed; and this speed assumes ideal
+circumstances (no other user contending for network bandwidth).  Thus,
+questions of disk access, remote display, and current telephone
+connection speed make transmission of megabyte-size images impractical.
+
+BESSER then discussed ways to deal with these large images, for example,
+compression and decompression at the user's end.  In this connection, the
+issues of how much one is willing to lose in the compression process and
+what image quality one needs in the first place are unknown.  But what is
+known is that compression entails some loss of data.  BESSER urged that
+more studies be conducted on image quality in different situations, for
+example, what kind of images are needed for what kind of disciplines, and
+what kind of image quality is needed for a browsing tool, an intermediate
+viewing tool, and archiving.
+
+BESSER remarked two promising trends for compression:  from a technical
+perspective, algorithms that use what is called subjective redundancy
+employ principles from visual psycho-physics to identify and remove
+information from the image that the human eye cannot perceive; from an
+interchange and interoperability perspective, the JPEG (i.e., Joint
+Photographic Experts Group, an ISO standard) compression algorithms also
+offer promise.  These issues of compression and decompression, BESSER
+argued, resembled those raised earlier concerning the design of different
+platforms.  Gauging the capabilities of potential users constitutes a
+primary goal.  BESSER advocated layering or separating the images from
+the applications that retrieve and display them, to avoid tying them to
+particular software.
+
+BESSER detailed several lessons learned from his work at Berkeley with
+Imagequery, especially the advantages and disadvantages of using
+X-Windows.  In the latter category, for example, retrieval is tied
+directly to one's data, an intolerable situation in the long run on a
+networked system.  Finally, BESSER described a project of Jim Wallace at
+the Smithsonian Institution, who is mounting images in a extremely
+rudimentary way on the Compuserv and Genie networks and is preparing to
+mount them on America On Line.  Although the average user takes over
+thirty minutes to download these images (assuming a fairly fast modem),
+nevertheless, images have been downloaded 25,000 times.
+
+BESSER concluded his talk with several comments on the business
+arrangement between the Smithsonian and Compuserv.  He contended that not
+enough is known concerning the value of images.

+DISCUSSION * Creating digitized photographic collections nearly
+impossible except with large organizations like museums * Need for study
+to determine quality of images users will tolerate *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+During the brief exchange between LESK and BESSER that followed, several
+clarifications emerged.
+
+LESK argued that the photographers were far ahead of BESSER:  It is
+almost impossible to create such digitized photographic collections
+except with large organizations like museums, because all the
+photographic agencies have been going crazy about this and will not sign
+licensing agreements on any sort of reasonable terms.  LESK had heard
+that National Geographic, for example, had tried to buy the right to use
+some image in some kind of educational production for $100 per image, but
+the photographers will not touch it.  They want accounting and payment
+for each use, which cannot be accomplished within the system.  BESSER
+responded that a consortium of photographers, headed by a former National
+Geographic photographer, had started assembling its own collection of
+electronic reproductions of images, with the money going back to the
+cooperative.
+
+LESK contended that BESSER was unnecessarily pessimistic about multimedia
+images, because people are accustomed to low-quality images, particularly
+from video.  BESSER urged the launching of a study to determine what
+users would tolerate, what they would feel comfortable with, and what
+absolutely is the highest quality they would ever need.  Conceding that
+he had adopted a dire tone in order to arouse people about the issue,
+BESSER closed on a sanguine note by saying that he would not be in this
+business if he did not think that things could be accomplished.

+Effects of implementation of the Z39.50 protocol for information

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Ronald LARSEN, associate director for information technology, University
+of Maryland at College Park, first addressed the issues of scalability
+and modularity.  He noted the difficulty of anticipating the effects of
+orders-of-magnitude growth, reflecting on the twenty years of experience
+with the Arpanet and Internet.  Recalling the day's demonstrations of
+CD-ROM and optical disk material, he went on to ask if the field has yet
+learned how to scale new systems to enable delivery and dissemination
+across large-scale networks.
+
+LARSEN focused on the geometric growth of the Internet from its inception
+circa 1969 to the present, and the adjustments required to respond to
+that rapid growth.  To illustrate the issue of scalability, LARSEN
+considered computer networks as including three generic components: 
+computers, network communication nodes, and communication media.  Each
+component scales (e.g., computers range from PCs to supercomputers;
+network nodes scale from interface cards in a PC through sophisticated
+routers and gateways; and communication media range from 2,400-baud
+dial-up facilities through 4.5-Mbps backbone links, and eventually to
+multigigabit-per-second communication lines), and architecturally, the
+components are organized to scale hierarchically from local area networks
+to international-scale networks.  Such growth is made possible by
+building layers of communication protocols, as BESSER pointed out.
+By layering both physically and logically, a sense of scalability is
+maintained from local area networks in offices, across campuses, through
+bridges, routers, campus backbones, fiber-optic links, etc., up into
+regional networks and ultimately into national and international
+networks.
+
+LARSEN then illustrated the geometric growth over a two-year period--
+through September 1991--of the number of networks that comprise the
+Internet.  This growth has been sustained largely by the availability of
+three basic functions:  electronic mail, file transfer (ftp), and remote
+log-on (telnet).  LARSEN also reviewed the growth in the kind of traffic
+that occurs on the network.  Network traffic reflects the joint contributions
+of a larger population of users and increasing use per user.  Today one sees
+serious applications involving moving images across the network--a rarity
+ten years ago.  LARSEN recalled and concurred with BESSER's main point
+that the interesting problems occur at the application level.
+
+LARSEN then illustrated a model of a library's roles and functions in a
+network environment.  He noted, in particular, the placement of on-line
+catalogues onto the network and patrons obtaining access to the library
+increasingly through local networks, campus networks, and the Internet. 
+LARSEN supported LYNCH's earlier suggestion that we need to address
+fundamental questions of networked information in order to build
+environments that scale in the information sense as well as in the
+physical sense.
+
+LARSEN supported the role of the library system as the access point into
+the nation's electronic collections.  Implementation of the Z39.50
+protocol for information retrieval would make such access practical and
+feasible.  For example, this would enable patrons in Maryland to search
+California libraries, or other libraries around the world that are
+conformant with Z39.50 in a manner that is familiar to University of
+Maryland patrons.  This client-server model also supports moving beyond
+secondary content into primary content.  (The notion of how one links
+from secondary content to primary content, LARSEN said, represents a
+fundamental problem that requires rigorous thought.)  After noting
+numerous network experiments in accessing full-text materials, including
+projects supporting the ordering of materials across the network, LARSEN
+revisited the issue of transmitting high-density, high-resolution color
+images across the network and the large amounts of bandwidth they
+require.  He went on to address the bandwidth and synchronization
+problems inherent in sending full-motion video across the network.
+
+LARSEN illustrated the trade-off between volumes of data in bytes or
+orders of magnitude and the potential usage of that data.  He discussed
+transmission rates (particularly, the time it takes to move various forms
+of information), and what one could do with a network supporting
+multigigabit-per-second transmission.  At the moment, the network
+environment includes a composite of data-transmission requirements,
+volumes and forms, going from steady to bursty (high-volume) and from
+very slow to very fast.  This aggregate must be considered in the design,
+construction, and operation of multigigabyte networks.
+
+LARSEN's objective is to use the networks and library systems now being
+constructed to increase access to resources wherever they exist, and
+thus, to evolve toward an on-line electronic virtual library.
+
+LARSEN concluded by offering a snapshot of current trends:  continuing
+geometric growth in network capacity and number of users; slower
+development of applications; and glacial development and adoption of
+standards.  The challenge is to design and develop each new application
+system with network access and scalability in mind.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Edwin BROWNRIGG, executive director, Memex Research Institute, first
+polled the audience in order to seek out regular users of the Internet as
+well as those planning to use it some time in the future.  With nearly
+everybody in the room falling into one category or the other, BROWNRIGG
+made a point re access, namely that numerous individuals, especially those
+who use the Internet every day, take for granted their access to it, the
+speeds with which they are connected, and how well it all works. 
+However, as BROWNRIGG discovered between 1987 and 1989 in Australia,
+if one wants access to the Internet but cannot afford it or has some
+physical boundary that prevents her or him from gaining access, it can
+be extremely frustrating.  He suggested that because of economics and
+physical barriers we were beginning to create a world of haves and have-nots
+in the process of scholarly communication, even in the United States.
+
+BROWNRIGG detailed the development of MELVYL in academic year 1980-81 in
+the Division of Library Automation at the University of California, in
+order to underscore the issue of access to the system, which at the
+outset was extremely limited.  In short, the project needed to build a
+network, which at that time entailed use of satellite technology, that is,
+putting earth stations on campus and also acquiring some terrestrial links
+from the State of California's microwave system.  The installation of
+satellite links, however, did not solve the problem (which actually
+formed part of a larger problem involving politics and financial resources).
+For while the project team could get a signal onto a campus, it had no means
+of distributing the signal throughout the campus.  The solution involved
+adopting a recent development in wireless communication called packet radio,
+which combined the basic notion of packet-switching with radio.  The project
+used this technology to get the signal from a point on campus where it
+came down, an earth station for example, into the libraries, because it
+found that wiring the libraries, especially the older marble buildings,
+would cost $2,000-$5,000 per terminal.
+
+BROWNRIGG noted that, ten years ago, the project had neither the public
+policy nor the technology that would have allowed it to use packet radio
+in any meaningful way.  Since then much had changed.  He proceeded to
+detail research and development of the technology, how it is being
+deployed in California, and what direction he thought it would take.
+The design criteria are to produce a high-speed, one-time, low-cost,
+high-quality, secure, license-free device (packet radio) that one can
+plug in and play today, forget about it, and have access to the Internet. 
+By high speed, BROWNRIGG meant 1 megabyte and 1.5 megabytes.  Those units
+have been built, he continued, and are in the process of being
+type-certified by an independent underwriting laboratory so that they can
+be type-licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.  As is the
+case with citizens band, one will be able to purchase a unit and not have
+to worry about applying for a license.
+
+The basic idea, BROWNRIGG elaborated, is to take high-speed radio data
+transmission and create a backbone network that at certain strategic
+points in the network will "gateway" into a medium-speed packet radio
+(i.e., one that runs at 38.4 kilobytes), so that perhaps by 1994-1995
+people, like those in the audience for the price of a VCR could purchase
+a medium-speed radio for the office or home, have full network connectivity
+to the Internet, and partake of all its services, with no need for an FCC
+license and no regular bill from the local common carrier.  BROWNRIGG
+presented several details of a demonstration project currently taking
+place in San Diego and described plans, pending funding, to install a
+full-bore network in the San Francisco area.  This network will have 600
+nodes running at backbone speeds, and 100 of these nodes will be libraries,
+which in turn will be the gateway ports to the 38.4 kilobyte radios that
+will give coverage for the neighborhoods surrounding the libraries.
+
+BROWNRIGG next explained Part 15.247, a new rule within Title 47 of the
+Code of Federal Regulations enacted by the FCC in 1985.  This rule
+challenged the industry, which has only now risen to the occasion, to
+build a radio that would run at no more than one watt of output power and
+use a fairly exotic method of modulating the radio wave called spread
+spectrum.  Spread spectrum in fact permits the building of networks so
+that numerous data communications can occur simultaneously, without
+interfering with each other, within the same wide radio channel.
+
+BROWNRIGG explained that the frequencies at which the radios would run
+are very short wave signals.  They are well above standard microwave and
+radar.  With a radio wave that small, one watt becomes a tremendous punch
+per bit and thus makes transmission at reasonable speed possible.  In
+order to minimize the potential for congestion, the project is
+undertaking to reimplement software which has been available in the
+networking business and is taken for granted now, for example, TCP/IP,
+routing algorithms, bridges, and gateways.  In addition, the project
+plans to take the WAIS server software in the public domain and
+reimplement it so that one can have a WAIS server on a Mac instead of a
+Unix machine.  The Memex Research Institute believes that libraries, in
+particular, will want to use the WAIS servers with packet radio.  This
+project, which has a team of about twelve people, will run through 1993
+and will include the 100 libraries already mentioned as well as other
+professionals such as those in the medical profession, engineering, and
+law.  Thus, the need is to create an infrastructure of radios that do not
+move around, which, BROWNRIGG hopes, will solve a problem not only for
+libraries but for individuals who, by and large today, do not have access
+to the Internet from their homes and offices.

+DISCUSSION * Project operating frequencies *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+During a brief discussion period, which also concluded the day's
+proceedings, BROWNRIGG stated that the project was operating in four
+frequencies.  The slow speed is operating at 435 megahertz, and it would
+later go up to 920 megahertz.  With the high-speed frequency, the
+one-megabyte radios will run at 2.4 gigabits, and 1.5 will run at 5.7. 
+At 5.7, rain can be a factor, but it would have to be tropical rain,
+unlike what falls in most parts of the United States.

+ability to produce printed facsimiles or to replace paper with paper
+would be important, at least for the present generation of users and

+sufficiently high to return a paper replacement to the shelf.  CXP was
+only interested in using:  2) a system that was cost-effective, which
+meant that it had to be cost-competitive with the processes currently
+available, principally photocopy and microfilm, and 3) new or currently
+available product hardware and software.
+
+KENNEY described the advantages that using digital technology offers over
+both photocopy and microfilm:  1) The potential exists to create a higher
+quality reproduction of a deteriorating original than conventional
+light-lens technology.  2) Because a digital image is an encoded
+representation, it can be reproduced again and again with no resulting
+loss of quality, as opposed to the situation with light-lens processes,
+in which there is discernible difference between a second and a
+subsequent generation of an image.  3) A digital image can be manipulated
+in a number of ways to improve image capture; for example, Xerox has
+developed a windowing application that enables one to capture a page
+containing both text and illustrations in a manner that optimizes the
+reproduction of both.  (With light-lens technology, one must choose which
+to optimize, text or the illustration; in preservation microfilming, the
+current practice is to shoot an illustrated page twice, once to highlight
+the text and the second time to provide the best capture for the
+illustration.)  4) A digital image can also be edited, density levels
+adjusted to remove underlining and stains, and to increase legibility for
+faint documents.  5) On-screen inspection can take place at the time of
+initial setup and adjustments made prior to scanning, factors that
+substantially reduce the number of retakes required in quality control.
+
+A primary goal of CXP has been to evaluate the paper output printed on
+the Xerox DocuTech, a high-speed printer that produces 600-dpi pages from
+scanned images at a rate of 135 pages a minute.  KENNEY recounted several
+publishing challenges to represent faithful and legible reproductions of
+the originals that the 600-dpi copy for the most part successfully
+captured.  For example, many of the deteriorating volumes in the project
+were heavily illustrated with fine line drawings or halftones or came in
+languages such as Japanese, in which the buildup of characters comprised
+of varying strokes is difficult to reproduce at lower resolutions; a
+surprising number of them came with annotations and mathematical
+formulas, which it was critical to be able to duplicate exactly.
+
+KENNEY noted that 1) the copies are being printed on paper that meets the
+ANSI standards for performance, 2) the DocuTech printer meets the machine
+and toner requirements for proper adhesion of print to page, as described
+by the National Archives, and thus 3) paper product is considered to be
+the archival equivalent of preservation photocopy.
+
+KENNEY then discussed several samples of the quality achieved in the
+project that had been distributed in a handout, for example, a copy of a
+print-on-demand version of the 1911 Reed lecture on the steam turbine,
+which contains halftones, line drawings, and illustrations embedded in
+text; the first four loose pages in the volume compared the capture
+capabilities of scanning to photocopy for a standard test target, the
+IEEE standard 167A 1987 test chart.  In all instances scanning proved
+superior to photocopy, though only slightly more so in one.
+
+Conceding the simplistic nature of her review of the quality of scanning
+to photocopy, KENNEY described it as one representation of the kinds of
+settings that could be used with scanning capabilities on the equipment
+CXP uses.  KENNEY also pointed out that CXP investigated the quality
+achieved with binary scanning only, and noted the great promise in gray
+scale and color scanning, whose advantages and disadvantages need to be
+examined.  She argued further that scanning resolutions and file formats
+can represent a complex trade-off between the time it takes to capture
+material, file size, fidelity to the original, and on-screen display; and
+printing and equipment availability.  All these factors must be taken
+into consideration.
+
+CXP placed primary emphasis on the production in a timely and
+cost-effective manner of printed facsimiles that consisted largely of
+black-and-white text.  With binary scanning, large files may be
+compressed efficiently and in a lossless manner (i.e., no data is lost in
+the process of compressing [and decompressing] an image--the exact
+bit-representation is maintained) using Group 4 CCITT (i.e., the French
+acronym for International Consultative Committee for Telegraph and
+Telephone) compression.  CXP was getting compression ratios of about
+forty to one.  Gray-scale compression, which primarily uses JPEG, is much
+less economical and can represent a lossy compression (i.e., not
+lossless), so that as one compresses and decompresses, the illustration
+is subtly changed.  While binary files produce a high-quality printed
+version, it appears 1) that other combinations of spatial resolution with
+gray and/or color hold great promise as well, and 2) that gray scale can
+represent a tremendous advantage for on-screen viewing.  The quality
+associated with binary and gray scale also depends on the equipment used. 
+For instance, binary scanning produces a much better copy on a binary
+printer.
+
+Among CXP's findings concerning the production of microfilm from digital
+files, KENNEY reported that the digital files for the same Reed lecture
+were used to produce sample film using an electron beam recorder.  The
+resulting film was faithful to the image capture of the digital files,
+and while CXP felt that the text and image pages represented in the Reed
+lecture were superior to that of the light-lens film, the resolution
+readings for the 600 dpi were not as high as standard microfilming. 
+KENNEY argued that the standards defined for light-lens technology are
+not totally transferable to a digital environment.  Moreover, they are
+based on definition of quality for a preservation copy.  Although making
+this case will prove to be a long, uphill struggle, CXP plans to continue
+to investigate the issue over the course of the next year.
+
+KENNEY concluded this portion of her talk with a discussion of the
+advantages of creating film:  it can serve as a primary backup and as a
+preservation master to the digital file; it could then become the print
+or production master and service copies could be paper, film, optical
+disks, magnetic media, or on-screen display.
+
+Finally, KENNEY presented details re production:
+
+     * Development and testing of a moderately-high resolution production
+     scanning workstation represented a third goal of CXP; to date, 1,000
+     volumes have been scanned, or about 300,000 images.
+
+     * The resulting digital files are stored and used to produce
+     hard-copy replacements for the originals and additional prints on
+     demand; although the initial costs are high, scanning technology
+     offers an affordable means for reformatting brittle material.
+
+     * A technician in production mode can scan 300 pages per hour when
+     performing single-sheet scanning, which is a necessity when working
+     with truly brittle paper; this figure is expected to increase
+     significantly with subsequent iterations of the software from Xerox;
+     a three-month time-and-cost study of scanning found that the average
+     300-page book would take about an hour and forty minutes to scan
+     (this figure included the time for setup, which involves keying in
+     primary bibliographic data, going into quality control mode to
+     define page size, establishing front-to-back registration, and
+     scanning sample pages to identify a default range of settings for
+     the entire book--functions not dissimilar to those performed by
+     filmers or those preparing a book for photocopy).
+
+     * The final step in the scanning process involved rescans, which
+     happily were few and far between, representing well under 1 percent
+     of the total pages scanned.
+
+In addition to technician time, CXP costed out equipment, amortized over
+four years, the cost of storing and refreshing the digital files every
+four years, and the cost of printing and binding, book-cloth binding, a
+paper reproduction.  The total amounted to a little under $65 per single
+300-page volume, with 30 percent overhead included--a figure competitive
+with the prices currently charged by photocopy vendors.
+
+Of course, with scanning, in addition to the paper facsimile, one is left
+with a digital file from which subsequent copies of the book can be
+produced for a fraction of the cost of photocopy, with readers afforded
+choices in the form of these copies.
+
+KENNEY concluded that digital technology offers an electronic means for a
+library preservation effort to pay for itself.  If a brittle-book program
+included the means of disseminating reprints of books that are in demand
+by libraries and researchers alike, the initial investment in capture
+could be recovered and used to preserve additional but less popular
+books.  She disclosed that an economic model for a self-sustaining
+program could be developed for CXP's report to the Commission on
+Preservation and Access (CPA).
+
+KENNEY stressed that the focus of CXP has been on obtaining high quality
+in a production environment.  The use of digital technology is viewed as
+an affordable alternative to other reformatting options.

+ANDRE * Overview and history of NATDP * Various agricultural CD-ROM
+products created inhouse and by service bureaus * Pilot project on
+Internet transmission * Additional products in progress *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Pamela ANDRE, associate director for automation, National Agricultural
+Text Digitizing Program (NATDP), National Agricultural Library (NAL),
+presented an overview of NATDP, which has been underway at NAL the last
+four years, before Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details.  ANDRE
+defined agricultural information as a broad range of material going from
+basic and applied research in the hard sciences to the one-page pamphlets
+that are distributed by the cooperative state extension services on such
+things as how to grow blueberries.
+
+NATDP began in late 1986 with a meeting of representatives from the
+land-grant library community to deal with the issue of electronic
+information.  NAL and forty-five of these libraries banded together to
+establish this project--to evaluate the technology for converting what
+were then source documents in paper form into electronic form, to provide
+access to that digital information, and then to distribute it. 
+Distributing that material to the community--the university community as
+well as the extension service community, potentially down to the county
+level--constituted the group's chief concern.
+
+Since January 1988 (when the microcomputer-based scanning system was
+installed at NAL), NATDP has done a variety of things, concerning which
+ZIDAR would provide further details.  For example, the first technology
+considered in the project's discussion phase was digital videodisc, which
+indicates how long ago it was conceived.
+
+Over the four years of this project, four separate CD-ROM products on
+four different agricultural topics were created, two at a
+scanning-and-OCR station installed at NAL, and two by service bureaus. 
+Thus, NATDP has gained comparative information in terms of those relative
+costs.  Each of these products contained the full ASCII text as well as
+page images of the material, or between 4,000 and 6,000 pages of material
+on these disks.  Topics included aquaculture, food, agriculture and
+science (i.e., international agriculture and research), acid rain, and
+Agent Orange, which was the final product distributed (approximately
+eighteen months before the Workshop).
+
+The third phase of NATDP focused on delivery mechanisms other than
+CD-ROM.  At the suggestion of Clifford LYNCH, who was a technical
+consultant to the project at this point, NATDP became involved with the
+Internet and initiated a project with the help of North Carolina State
+University, in which fourteen of the land-grant university libraries are
+transmitting digital images over the Internet in response to interlibrary
+loan requests--a topic for another meeting.  At this point, the pilot
+project had been completed for about a year and the final report would be
+available shortly after the Workshop.  In the meantime, the project's
+success had led to its extension.  (ANDRE noted that one of the first
+things done under the program title was to select a retrieval package to
+use with subsequent products; Windows Personal Librarian was the package
+of choice after a lengthy evaluation.)
+  
+Three additional products had been planned and were in progress:
+
+     1) An arrangement with the American Society of Agronomy--a
+     professional society that has published the Agronomy Journal since
+     about 1908--to scan and create bit-mapped images of its journal. 
+     ASA granted permission first to put and then to distribute this
+     material in electronic form, to hold it at NAL, and to use these
+     electronic images as a mechanism to deliver documents or print out
+     material for patrons, among other uses.  Effectively, NAL has the
+     right to use this material in support of its program. 
+     (Significantly, this arrangement offers a potential cooperative
+     model for working with other professional societies in agriculture
+     to try to do the same thing--put the journals of particular interest
+     to agriculture research into electronic form.)
+
+     2) An extension of the earlier product on aquaculture.
+
+     3) The George Washington Carver Papers--a joint project with
+     Tuskegee University to scan and convert from microfilm some 3,500
+     images of Carver's papers, letters, and drawings.
+
+It was anticipated that all of these products would appear no more than
+six months after the Workshop.

+
+Judith ZIDAR, coordinator, National Agricultural Text Digitizing Program
+(NATDP), National Agricultural Library (NAL), illustrated the technical
+details of NATDP, including her primary responsibility, scanning and
+creating databases on a topic and putting them on CD-ROM.
+
+(ZIDAR remarked a separate arena from the CD-ROM projects, although the
+processing of the material is nearly identical, in which NATDP is also
+scanning material and loading it on a Next microcomputer, which in turn
+is linked to NAL's integrated library system.  Thus, searches in NAL's
+bibliographic database will enable people to pull up actual page images
+and text for any documents that have been entered.)
+
+In accordance with the session's topic, ZIDAR focused her illustrated
+talk on image capture, offering a primer on the three main steps in the
+process:  1) assemble the printed publications; 2) design the database
+(database design occurs in the process of preparing the material for
+scanning; this step entails reviewing and organizing the material,
+defining the contents--what will constitute a record, what kinds of
+fields will be captured in terms of author, title, etc.); 3) perform a
+certain amount of markup on the paper publications.  NAL performs this
+task record by record, preparing work sheets or some other sort of
+tracking material and designing descriptors and other enhancements to be
+added to the data that will not be captured from the printed publication. 
+Part of this process also involves determining NATDP's file and directory
+structure:  NATDP attempts to avoid putting more than approximately 100
+images in a directory, because placing more than that on a CD-ROM would
+reduce the access speed.
+
+This up-front process takes approximately two weeks for a
+6,000-7,000-page database.  The next step is to capture the page images. 
+How long this process takes is determined by the decision whether or not
+to perform OCR.  Not performing OCR speeds the process, whereas text
+capture requires greater care because of the quality of the image:  it
+has to be straighter and allowance must be made for text on a page, not
+just for the capture of photographs.
+
+NATDP keys in tracking data, that is, a standard bibliographic record
+including the title of the book and the title of the chapter, which will
+later either become the access information or will be attached to the
+front of a full-text record so that it is searchable.
+
+Images are scanned from a bound or unbound publication, chiefly from
+bound publications in the case of NATDP, however, because often they are
+the only copies and the publications are returned to the shelves.  NATDP
+usually scans one record at a time, because its database tracking system
+tracks the document in that way and does not require further logical
+separating of the images.  After performing optical character
+recognition, NATDP moves the images off the hard disk and maintains a
+volume sheet.  Though the system tracks electronically, all the
+processing steps are also tracked manually with a log sheet.
+
+ZIDAR next illustrated the kinds of adjustments that one can make when
+scanning from paper and microfilm, for example, redoing images that need
+special handling, setting for dithering or gray scale, and adjusting for
+brightness or for the whole book at one time.
+
+NATDP is scanning at 300 dots per inch, a standard scanning resolution. 
+Though adequate for capturing text that is all of a standard size, 300
+dpi is unsuitable for any kind of photographic material or for very small
+text.  Many scanners allow for different image formats, TIFF, of course,
+being a de facto standard.  But if one intends to exchange images with
+other people, the ability to scan other image formats, even if they are
+less common, becomes highly desirable.
+
+CCITT Group 4 is the standard compression for normal black-and-white
+images, JPEG for gray scale or color.   ZIDAR recommended 1) using the
+standard compressions, particularly if one attempts to make material
+available and to allow users to download images and reuse them from
+CD-ROMs; and 2) maintaining the ability to output an uncompressed image,
+because in image exchange uncompressed images are more likely to be able
+to cross platforms.
+
+ZIDAR emphasized the importance of de-skewing and filtering as
+requirements on NATDP's upgraded system.  For instance, scanning bound
+books, particularly books published by the federal government whose pages
+are skewed, and trying to scan them straight if OCR is to be performed,
+is extremely time-consuming.  The same holds for filtering of
+poor-quality or older materials.
+
+ZIDAR described image capture from microform, using as an example three
+reels from a sixty-seven-reel set of the papers and letters of George
+Washington Carver that had been produced by Tuskegee University.  These
+resulted in approximately 3,500 images, which NATDP had had scanned by
+its service contractor, Science Applications International Corporation
+(SAIC).  NATDP also created bibliographic records for access.  (NATDP did
+not have such specialized equipment as a microfilm scanner.
+
+Unfortunately, the process of scanning from microfilm was not an
+unqualified success, ZIDAR reported:  because microfilm frame sizes vary,
+occasionally some frames were missed, which without spending much time
+and money could not be recaptured.
+
+OCR could not be performed from the scanned images of the frames.  The
+bleeding in the text simply output text, when OCR was run, that could not
+even be edited.  NATDP tested for negative versus positive images,
+landscape versus portrait orientation, and single- versus dual-page
+microfilm, none of which seemed to affect the quality of the image; but
+also on none of them could OCR be performed.
+
+In selecting the microfilm they would use, therefore, NATDP had other
+factors in mind.  ZIDAR noted two factors that influenced the quality of
+the images:  1) the inherent quality of the original and 2) the amount of
+size reduction on the pages.
+
+The Carver papers were selected because they are informative and visually
+interesting, treat a single subject, and are valuable in their own right. 
+The images were scanned and divided into logical records by SAIC, then
+delivered, and loaded onto NATDP's system, where bibliographic
+information taken directly from the images was added.  Scanning was
+completed in summer 1991 and by the end of summer 1992 the disk was
+scheduled to be published.
+
+Problems encountered during processing included the following:  Because
+the microfilm scanning had to be done in a batch, adjustment for
+individual page variations was not possible.  The frame size varied on
+account of the nature of the material, and therefore some of the frames
+were missed while others were just partial frames.  The only way to go
+back and capture this material was to print out the page with the
+microfilm reader from the missing frame and then scan it in from the
+page, which was extremely time-consuming.  The quality of the images
+scanned from the printout of the microfilm compared unfavorably with that
+of the original images captured directly from the microfilm.  The
+inability to perform OCR also was a major disappointment.  At the time,
+computer output microfilm was unavailable to test.
+
+The equipment used for a scanning system was the last topic addressed by
+ZIDAR.  The type of equipment that one would purchase for a scanning
+system included:  a microcomputer, at least a 386, but preferably a 486;
+a large hard disk, 380 megabyte at minimum; a multi-tasking operating
+system that allows one to run some things in batch in the background
+while scanning or doing text editing, for example, Unix or OS/2 and,
+theoretically, Windows; a high-speed scanner and scanning software that
+allows one to make the various adjustments mentioned earlier; a
+high-resolution monitor (150 dpi ); OCR software and hardware to perform
+text recognition; an optical disk subsystem on which to archive all the
+images as the processing is done; file management and tracking software.
+
+ZIDAR opined that the software one purchases was more important than the
+hardware and might also cost more than the hardware, but it was likely to
+prove critical to the success or failure of one's system.  In addition to
+a stand-alone scanning workstation for image capture, then, text capture
+requires one or two editing stations networked to this scanning station
+to perform editing.  Editing the text takes two or three times as long as
+capturing the images.
+
+Finally, ZIDAR stressed the importance of buying an open system that allows
+for more than one vendor, complies with standards, and can be upgraded.

+
+Donald WATERS, head of the Systems Office, Yale University Library,
+reported on the progress of a master plan for a project at Yale to
+convert microfilm to digital imagery, Project Open Book (POB).  Stating
+that POB was in an advanced stage of planning, WATERS detailed, in
+particular, the process of selecting a vendor partner and several key
+issues under discussion as Yale prepares to move into the project itself. 
+He commented first on the vision that serves as the context of POB and
+then described its purpose and scope.
+
+WATERS sees the library of the future not necessarily as an electronic
+library but as a place that generates, preserves, and improves for its
+clients ready access to both intellectual and physical recorded
+knowledge.  Electronic tools must find a place in the library in the
+context of this vision.  Several roles for electronic tools include
+serving as:  indirect sources of electronic knowledge or as "finding"
+aids (the on-line catalogues, the article-level indices, registers for
+documents and archives); direct sources of recorded knowledge; full-text
+images; and various kinds of compound sources of recorded knowledge (the
+so-called compound documents of Hypertext, mixed text and image,
+mixed-text image format, and multimedia).
+
+POB is looking particularly at images and an image library, the uses to
+which images will be put (e.g., storage, printing, browsing, and then use
+as input for other processes), OCR as a subsequent process to image
+capture, or creating an image library, and also possibly generating
+microfilm.
+
+While input will come from a variety of sources, POB is considering
+especially input from preservation microfilm.  A possible outcome is that
+the film and paper which provide the input for the image library
+eventually may go off into remote storage, and that the image library may
+be the primary access tool.
+
+The purpose and scope of POB focus on imaging.  Though related to CXP,
+POB has two features which distinguish it:  1) scale--conversion of
+10,000 volumes into digital image form; and 2) source--conversion from
+microfilm.  Given these features, several key working hypotheses guide
+POB, including:  1) Since POB is using microfilm, it is not concerned with
+the image library as a preservation medium.  2) Digital imagery can improve
+access to recorded knowledge through printing and network distribution at
+a modest incremental cost of microfilm.  3) Capturing and storing documents
+in a digital image form is necessary to further improvements in access.
+(POB distinguishes between the imaging, digitizing process and OCR,
+which at this stage it does not plan to perform.)
+
+Currently in its first or organizational phase, POB found that it could
+use a vendor selection process to facilitate a good deal of the
+organizational work (e.g., creating a project team and advisory board,
+confirming the validity of the plan, establishing the cost of the project
+and a budget, selecting the materials to convert, and then raising the
+necessary funds).
+
+POB developed numerous selection criteria, including:  a firm committed
+to image-document management, the ability to serve as systems integrator
+in a large-scale project over several years, interest in developing the
+requisite software as a standard rather than a custom product, and a
+willingness to invest substantial resources in the project itself.
+
+Two vendors, DEC and Xerox, were selected as finalists in October 1991,
+and with the support of the Commission on Preservation and Access, each
+was commissioned to generate a detailed requirements analysis for the
+project and then to submit a formal proposal for the completion of the
+project, which included a budget and costs. The terms were that POB would
+pay the loser.  The results for Yale of involving a vendor included: 
+broad involvement of Yale staff across the board at a relatively low
+cost, which may have long-term significance in carrying out the project
+(twenty-five to thirty university people are engaged in POB); better
+understanding of the factors that affect corporate response to markets
+for imaging products; a competitive proposal; and a more sophisticated
+view of the imaging markets.
+
+The most important factor that distinguished the vendors under
+consideration was their identification with the customer.  The size and
+internal complexity of the company also was an important factor.  POB was
+looking at large companies that had substantial resources.  In the end,
+the process generated for Yale two competitive proposals, with Xerox's
+the clear winner.  WATERS then described the components of the proposal,
+the design principles, and some of the costs estimated for the process.
+
+Components are essentially four:  a conversion subsystem, a
+network-accessible storage subsystem for 10,000 books (and POB expects
+200 to 600 dpi storage), browsing stations distributed on the campus
+network, and network access to the image printers.
+
+Among the design principles, POB wanted conversion at the highest
+possible resolution.  Assuming TIFF files, TIFF files with Group 4
+compression, TCP/IP, and ethernet network on campus, POB wanted a
+client-server approach with image documents distributed to the
+workstations and made accessible through native workstation interfaces
+such as Windows.  POB also insisted on a phased approach to
+implementation:  1) a stand-alone, single-user, low-cost entry into the
+business with a workstation focused on conversion and allowing POB to
+explore user access; 2) movement into a higher-volume conversion with
+network-accessible storage and multiple access stations; and 3) a
+high-volume conversion, full-capacity storage, and multiple browsing
+stations distributed throughout the campus.
+
+The costs proposed for start-up assumed the existence of the Yale network
+and its two DocuTech image printers.  Other start-up costs are estimated
+at $1 million over the three phases.  At the end of the project, the annual
+operating costs estimated primarily for the software and hardware proposed
+come to about $60,000, but these exclude costs for labor needed in the
+conversion process, network and printer usage, and facilities management.
+
+Finally, the selection process produced for Yale a more sophisticated
+view of the imaging markets:  the management of complex documents in
+image form is not a preservation problem, not a library problem, but a
+general problem in a broad, general industry.  Preservation materials are
+useful for developing that market because of the qualities of the
+material.  For example, much of it is out of copyright.  The resolution
+of key issues such as the quality of scanning and image browsing also
+will affect development of that market.
+
+The technology is readily available but changing rapidly.  In this
+context of rapid change, several factors affect quality and cost, to
+which POB intends to pay particular attention, for example, the various
+levels of resolution that can be achieved.  POB believes it can bring
+resolution up to 600 dpi, but an interpolation process from 400 to 600 is
+more likely.  The variation quality in microfilm will prove to be a
+highly important factor.  POB may reexamine the standards used to film in
+the first place by looking at this process as a follow-on to microfilming.
+
+Other important factors include:  the techniques available to the
+operator for handling material, the ways of integrating quality control
+into the digitizing work flow, and a work flow that includes indexing and
+storage.  POB's requirement was to be able to deal with quality control
+at the point of scanning.  Thus, thanks to Xerox, POB anticipates having
+a mechanism which will allow it not only to scan in batch form, but to
+review the material as it goes through the scanner and control quality
+from the outset.
+
+The standards for measuring quality and costs depend greatly on the uses
+of the material, including subsequent OCR, storage, printing, and
+browsing.  But especially at issue for POB is the facility for browsing. 
+This facility, WATERS said, is perhaps the weakest aspect of imaging
+technology and the most in need of development.
+
+A variety of factors affect the usability of complex documents in image
+form, among them:  1) the ability of the system to handle the full range
+of document types, not just monographs but serials, multi-part
+monographs, and manuscripts; 2) the location of the database of record
+for bibliographic information about the image document, which POB wants
+to enter once and in the most useful place, the on-line catalog; 3) a
+document identifier for referencing the bibliographic information in one
+place and the images in another; 4) the technique for making the basic
+internal structure of the document accessible to the reader; and finally,
+5) the physical presentation on the CRT of those documents.  POB is ready
+to complete this phase now.  One last decision involves deciding which
+material to scan.

+DISCUSSION * TIFF files constitute de facto standard * NARA's experience
+with image conversion software and text conversion * RFC 1314 *
+Considerable flux concerning available hardware and software solutions *
+NAL through-put rate during scanning * Window management questions *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+In the question-and-answer period that followed WATERS's presentation,
+the following points emerged:
+
+     * ZIDAR's statement about using TIFF files as a standard meant de
+     facto standard.  This is what most people use and typically exchange
+     with other groups, across platforms, or even occasionally across
+     display software.
+
+     * HOLMES commented on the unsuccessful experience of NARA in
+     attempting to run image-conversion software or to exchange between
+     applications:  What are supposedly TIFF files go into other software
+     that is supposed to be able to accept TIFF but cannot recognize the
+     format and cannot deal with it, and thus renders the exchange
+     useless.  Re text conversion, he noted the different recognition
+     rates obtained by substituting the make and model of scanners in
+     NARA's recent test of an "intelligent" character-recognition product
+     for a new company.  In the selection of hardware and software,
+     HOLMES argued, software no longer constitutes the overriding factor
+     it did until about a year ago; rather it is perhaps important to
+     look at both now.
+
+     * Danny Cohen and Alan Katz of the University of Southern California
+     Information Sciences Institute began circulating as an Internet RFC
+     (RFC 1314) about a month ago a standard for a TIFF interchange
+     format for Internet distribution of monochrome bit-mapped images,
+     which LYNCH said he believed would be used as a de facto standard.
+
+     * FLEISCHHAUER's impression from hearing these reports and thinking
+     about AM's experience was that there is considerable flux concerning
+     available hardware and software solutions.  HOOTON agreed and
+     commented at the same time on ZIDAR's statement that the equipment
+     employed affects the results produced.  One cannot draw a complete
+     conclusion by saying it is difficult or impossible to perform OCR
+     from scanning microfilm, for example, with that device,  that set of
+     parameters, and system requirements, because numerous other people
+     are accomplishing just that, using other components, perhaps. 
+     HOOTON opined that both the hardware and the software were highly
+     important.  Most of the problems discussed today have been solved in
+     numerous different ways by other people.  Though it is good to be
+     cognizant of various experiences, this is not to say that it will
+     always be thus.
+
+     * At NAL, the through-put rate of the scanning process for paper,
+     page by page, performing OCR, ranges from 300 to 600 pages per day;
+     not performing OCR is considerably faster, although how much faster
+     is not known.  This is for scanning from bound books, which is much
+     slower.
+
+     * WATERS commented on window management questions:  DEC proposed an
+     X-Windows solution which was problematical for two reasons.  One was
+     POB's requirement to be able to manipulate images on the workstation
+     and bring them down to the workstation itself and the other was
+     network usage.

+THOMA * Illustration of deficiencies in scanning and storage process *
+Image quality in this process * Different costs entailed by better image
+quality * Techniques for overcoming various de-ficiencies:  fixed
+thresholding, dynamic thresholding, dithering, image merge * Page edge
+effects *   
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+George THOMA, chief, Communications Engineering Branch, National Library
+of Medicine (NLM), illustrated several of the deficiencies discussed by
+the previous speakers.  He introduced the topic of special problems by
+noting the advantages of electronic imaging.  For example, it is regenerable
+because it is a coded file, and real-time quality control is possible with
+electronic capture, whereas in photographic capture it is not.
+
+One of the difficulties discussed in the scanning and storage process was
+image quality which, without belaboring the obvious, means different
+things for maps, medical X-rays, or broadcast television.  In the case of
+documents, THOMA said, image quality boils down to legibility of the
+textual parts, and fidelity in the case of gray or color photo print-type
+material.  Legibility boils down to scan density, the standard in most
+cases being 300 dpi.  Increasing the resolution with scanners that
+perform 600 or 1200 dpi, however, comes at a cost.
+
+Better image quality entails at least four different kinds of costs:  1)
+equipment costs, because the CCD (i.e., charge-couple device) with
+greater number of elements costs more;  2) time costs that translate to
+the actual capture costs, because manual labor is involved (the time is
+also dependent on the fact that more data has to be moved around in the
+machine in the scanning or network devices that perform the scanning as
+well as the storage);  3) media costs, because at high resolutions larger
+files have to be stored; and 4) transmission costs, because there is just
+more data to be transmitted.
+
+But while resolution takes care of the issue of legibility in image
+quality, other deficiencies have to do with contrast and elements on the
+page scanned or the image that needed to be removed or clarified.  Thus,
+THOMA proceeded to illustrate various deficiencies, how they are
+manifested, and several techniques to overcome them.
+
+Fixed thresholding was the first technique described, suitable for
+black-and-white text, when the contrast does not vary over the page.  One
+can have many different threshold levels in scanning devices.  Thus,
+THOMA offered an example of extremely poor contrast, which resulted from
+the fact that the stock was a heavy red.  This is the sort of image that
+when microfilmed fails to provide any legibility whatsoever.  Fixed
+thresholding is the way to change the black-to-red contrast to the
+desired black-to-white contrast.
+
+Other examples included material that had been browned or yellowed by
+age.  This was also a case of contrast deficiency, and correction was
+done by fixed thresholding.  A final example boils down to the same
+thing, slight variability, but it is not significant.  Fixed thresholding
+solves this problem as well.  The microfilm equivalent is certainly legible,
+but it comes with dark areas.  Though THOMA did not have a slide of the
+microfilm in this case, he did show the reproduced electronic image.
+
+When one has variable contrast over a page or the lighting over the page
+area varies, especially in the case where a bound volume has light
+shining on it, the image must be processed by a dynamic thresholding
+scheme.  One scheme, dynamic averaging, allows the threshold level not to
+be fixed but to be recomputed for every pixel from the neighboring
+characteristics.  The neighbors of a pixel determine where the threshold
+should be set for that pixel.
+
+THOMA showed an example of a page that had been made deficient by a
+variety of techniques, including a burn mark, coffee stains, and a yellow
+marker.  Application of a fixed-thresholding scheme, THOMA argued, might
+take care of several deficiencies on the page but not all of them. 
+Performing the calculation for a dynamic threshold setting, however,
+removes most of the deficiencies so that at least the text is legible.
+
+Another problem is representing a gray level with black-and-white pixels
+by a process known as dithering or electronic screening.  But dithering
+does not provide good image quality for pure black-and-white textual
+material.  THOMA illustrated this point with examples. Although its
+suitability for photoprint is the reason for electronic screening or
+dithering, it cannot be used for every compound image.  In the document
+that was distributed by CXP, THOMA noticed that the dithered image of the
+IEEE test chart evinced some deterioration in the text.  He presented an
+extreme example of deterioration in the text in which compounded
+documents had to be set right by other techniques.  The technique
+illustrated by the present example was an image merge in which the page
+is scanned twice and the settings go from fixed threshold to the
+dithering matrix; the resulting images are merged to give the best
+results with each technique.
+
+THOMA illustrated how dithering is also used in nonphotographic or
+nonprint materials with an example of a grayish page from a medical text,
+which was reproduced to show all of the gray that appeared in the
+original.  Dithering provided a reproduction of all the gray in the
+original of another example from the same text.
+
+THOMA finally illustrated the problem of bordering, or page-edge,
+effects.  Books and bound volumes that are placed on a photocopy machine
+or a scanner produce page-edge effects that are undesirable for two
+reasons:  1) the aesthetics of the image; after all, if the image is to
+be preserved, one does not necessarily want to keep all of its
+deficiencies; 2) compression (with the bordering problem THOMA
+illustrated, the compression ratio deteriorated tremendously).  One way
+to eliminate this more serious problem is to have the operator at the
+point of scanning window the part of the image that is desirable and
+automatically turn all of the pixels out of that picture to white.

+FLEISCHHAUER * AM's experience with scanning bound materials * Dithering
+*
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Carl FLEISCHHAUER, coordinator, American Memory, Library of Congress,
+reported AM's experience with scanning bound materials, which he likened
+to the problems involved in using photocopying machines.  Very few
+devices in the industry offer book-edge scanning, let alone book cradles. 
+The problem may be unsolvable, FLEISCHHAUER said, because a large enough
+market does not exist for a preservation-quality scanner.  AM is using a
+Kurzweil scanner, which is a book-edge scanner now sold by Xerox.
+
+Devoting the remainder of his brief presentation to dithering,
+FLEISCHHAUER related AM's experience with a contractor who was using
+unsophisticated equipment and software to reduce moire patterns from
+printed halftones.  AM took the same image and used the dithering
+algorithm that forms part of the same Kurzweil Xerox scanner; it
+disguised moire patterns much more effectively.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER also observed that dithering produces a binary file which is
+useful for numerous purposes, for example, printing it on a laser printer
+without having to "re-halftone" it.  But it tends to defeat efficient
+compression, because the very thing that dithers to reduce moire patterns
+also tends to work against compression schemes.  AM thought the
+difference in image quality was worth it.

+DISCUSSION * Relative use as a criterion for POB's selection of books to
+be converted into digital form *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+During the discussion period, WATERS noted that one of the criteria for
+selecting books among the 10,000 to be converted into digital image form
+would be how much relative use they would receive--a subject still
+requiring evaluation.  The challenge will be to understand whether
+coherent bodies of material will increase usage or whether POB should
+seek material that is being used, scan that, and make it more accessible. 
+POB might decide to digitize materials that are already heavily used, in
+order to make them more accessible and decrease wear on them.  Another
+approach would be to provide a large body of intellectually coherent
+material that may be used more in digital form than it is currently used
+in microfilm.  POB would seek material that was out of copyright.

+
+Jean BARONAS, senior manager, Department of Standards and Technology,
+Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM), described the
+not-for-profit association and the national and international programs
+for standardization in which AIIM is active.
+
+Accredited for twenty-five years as the nation's standards development
+organization for document image management, AIIM began life in a library
+community developing microfilm standards.  Today the association
+maintains both its library and business-image management standardization
+activities--and has moved into electronic image-management
+standardization (EIM).
+
+BARONAS defined the program's scope.  AIIM deals with:  1) the
+terminology of standards and of the technology it uses; 2) methods of
+measurement for the systems, as well as quality; 3) methodologies for
+users to evaluate and measure quality; 4) the features of apparatus used
+to manage and edit images; and 5) the procedures used to manage images.
+
+BARONAS noted that three types of documents are produced in the AIIM
+standards program:  the first two, accredited by the American National
+Standards Institute (ANSI), are standards and standard recommended
+practices.  Recommended practices differ from standards in that they
+contain more tutorial information.  A technical report is not an ANSI
+standard.  Because AIIM's policies and procedures for developing
+standards are approved by ANSI, its standards are labeled ANSI/AIIM,
+followed by the number and title of the standard.
+
+BARONAS then illustrated the domain of AIIM's standardization work.  For
+example, AIIM is the administrator of the U.S. Technical Advisory Group
+(TAG) to the International Standards Organization's (ISO) technical
+committee, TC l7l Micrographics and Optical Memories for Document and
+Image Recording, Storage, and Use.  AIIM officially works through ANSI in
+the international standardization process.
+
+BARONAS described AIIM's structure, including its board of directors, its
+standards board of twelve individuals active in the image-management
+industry, its strategic planning and legal admissibility task forces, and
+its National Standards Council, which is comprised of the members of a
+number of organizations who vote on every AIIM standard before it is
+published.  BARONAS pointed out that AIIM's liaisons deal with numerous
+other standards developers, including the optical disk community, office
+and publishing systems, image-codes-and-character set committees, and the
+National Information Standards Organization (NISO).
+
+BARONAS illustrated the procedures of TC l7l, which covers all aspects of
+image management.  When AIIM's national program has conceptualized a new
+project, it is usually submitted to the international level, so that the
+member countries of TC l7l can simultaneously work on the development of
+the standard or the technical report.  BARONAS also illustrated a classic
+microfilm standard, MS23, which deals with numerous imaging concepts that
+apply to electronic imaging.  Originally developed in the l970s, revised
+in the l980s, and revised again in l991, this standard is scheduled for
+another revision.  MS23 is an active standard whereby users may propose
+new density ranges and new methods of evaluating film images in the
+standard's revision.
+
+BARONAS detailed several electronic image-management standards, for
+instance, ANSI/AIIM MS44, a quality-control guideline for scanning 8.5"
+by 11" black-and-white office documents.  This standard is used with the
+IEEE fax image--a continuous tone photographic image with gray scales,
+text, and several continuous tone pictures--and AIIM test target number
+2, a representative document used in office document management.
+
+BARONAS next outlined the four categories of EIM standardization in which
+AIIM standards are being developed:  transfer and retrieval, evaluation,
+optical disc and document scanning applications, and design and
+conversion of documents.  She detailed several of the main projects of
+each:  1) in the category of image transfer and retrieval, a bi-level
+image transfer format, ANSI/AIIM MS53, which is a proposed standard that
+describes a file header for image transfer between unlike systems when
+the images are compressed using G3 and G4 compression; 2) the category of
+image evaluation, which includes the AIIM-proposed TR26 tutorial on image
+resolution (this technical report will treat the differences and
+similarities between classical or photographic and electronic imaging);
+3) design and conversion, which includes a proposed technical report
+called "Forms Design Optimization for EIM" (this report considers how
+general-purpose business forms can be best designed so that scanning is
+optimized; reprographic characteristics such as type, rules, background,
+tint, and color will likewise be treated in the technical report); 4)
+disk and document scanning applications includes a project a) on planning
+platters and disk management, b) on generating an application profile for
+EIM when images are stored and distributed on CD-ROM, and c) on
+evaluating SCSI2, and how a common command set can be generated for SCSI2
+so that document scanners are more easily integrated.  (ANSI/AIIM MS53
+will also apply to compressed images.)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Patricia BATTIN, president, the Commission on Preservation and Access
+(CPA), addressed the implications of standards for preservation.  She
+listed several areas where the library profession and the analog world of
+the printed book had made enormous contributions over the past hundred
+years--for example, in bibliographic formats, binding standards, and, most
+important, in determining what constitutes longevity or archival quality.
+
+Although standards have lightened the preservation burden through the
+development of national and international collaborative programs,
+nevertheless, a pervasive mistrust of other people's standards remains a
+major obstacle to successful cooperation, BATTIN said.
+
+The zeal to achieve perfection, regardless of the cost, has hindered
+rather than facilitated access in some instances, and in the digital
+environment, where no real standards exist, has brought an ironically
+just reward.
+
+BATTIN argued that standards are a double-edged sword for those concerned
+with the preservation of the human record, that is, the provision of
+access to recorded knowledge in a multitude of media as far into the
+future as possible.  Standards are essential to facilitate
+interconnectivity and access, but, BATTIN said, as LYNCH pointed out
+yesterday, if set too soon they can hinder creativity, expansion of
+capability, and the broadening of access.  The characteristics of
+standards for digital imagery differ radically from those for analog
+imagery.  And the nature of digital technology implies continuing
+volatility and change.  To reiterate, precipitous standard-setting can
+inhibit creativity, but delayed standard-setting results in chaos.
+
+Since in BATTIN'S opinion the near-term prognosis for reliable archival
+standards, as defined by librarians in the analog world, is poor, two
+alternatives remain:  standing pat with the old technology, or
+reconceptualizing.
+
+Preservation concerns for electronic media fall into two general domains. 
+One is the continuing assurance of access to knowledge originally
+generated, stored, disseminated, and used in electronic form.  This
+domain contains several subdivisions, including 1) the closed,
+proprietary systems discussed the previous day, bundled information such
+as electronic journals and government agency records, and electronically
+produced or captured raw data; and 2) the application of digital
+technologies to the reformatting of materials originally published on a
+deteriorating analog medium such as acid paper or videotape.
+
+The preservation of electronic media requires a reconceptualizing of our
+preservation principles during a volatile, standardless transition which
+may last far longer than any of us envision today.  BATTIN urged the
+necessity of shifting focus from assessing, measuring, and setting
+standards for the permanence of the medium to the concept of managing
+continuing access to information stored on a variety of media and
+requiring a variety of ever-changing hardware and software for access--a
+fundamental shift for the library profession.
+
+BATTIN offered a primer on how to move forward with reasonable confidence
+in a world without standards.  Her comments fell roughly into two sections:
+1) standards in the real world and 2) the politics of reproduction.
+
+In regard to real-world standards, BATTIN argued the need to redefine the
+concept of archive and to begin to think in terms of life cycles.  In
+the past, the naive assumption that paper would last forever produced a
+cavalier attitude toward life cycles.  The transient nature of the
+electronic media has compelled people to recognize and accept upfront the
+concept of life cycles in place of permanency.
+
+Digital standards have to be developed and set in a cooperative context
+to ensure efficient exchange of information.  Moreover, during this
+transition period, greater flexibility concerning how concepts such as
+backup copies and archival copies in the CXP are defined is necessary,
+or the opportunity to move forward will be lost.
+
+In terms of cooperation, particularly in the university setting, BATTIN
+also argued the need to avoid going off in a hundred different
+directions.  The CPA has catalyzed a small group of universities called
+the La Guardia Eight--because La Guardia Airport is where meetings take
+place--Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Princeton, Penn State, Tennessee,
+Stanford, and USC, to develop a digital preservation consortium to look
+at all these issues and develop de facto standards as we move along,
+instead of waiting for something that is officially blessed.  Continuing
+to apply analog values and definitions of standards to the digital
+environment, BATTIN said, will effectively lead to forfeiture of the
+benefits of digital technology to research and scholarship.
+
+Under the second rubric, the politics of reproduction, BATTIN reiterated
+an oft-made argument concerning the electronic library, namely, that it
+is more difficult to transform than to create, and nowhere is that belief
+expressed more dramatically than in the conversion of brittle books to
+new media.  Preserving information published in electronic media involves
+making sure the information remains accessible and that digital
+information is not lost through reproduction.  In the analog world of
+photocopies and microfilm, the issue of fidelity to the original becomes
+paramount, as do issues of "Whose fidelity?" and "Whose original?"
+
+BATTIN elaborated these arguments with a few examples from a recent study
+conducted by the CPA on the problems of preserving text and image. 
+Discussions with scholars, librarians, and curators in a variety of
+disciplines dependent on text and image generated a variety of concerns,
+for example:  1) Copy what is, not what the technology is capable of. 
+This is very important for the history of ideas.  Scholars wish to know
+what the author saw and worked from.  And make available at the
+workstation the opportunity to erase all the defects and enhance the
+presentation.  2) The fidelity of reproduction--what is good enough, what
+can we afford, and the difference it makes--issues of subjective versus
+objective resolution.  3) The differences between primary and secondary
+users.  Restricting the definition of primary user to the one in whose
+discipline the material has been published runs one headlong into the
+reality that these printed books have had a host of other users from a
+host of other disciplines, who not only were looking for very different
+things, but who also shared values very different from those of the
+primary user.  4) The relationship of the standard of reproduction to new
+capabilities of scholarship--the browsing standard versus an archival
+standard.  How good must the archival standard be?  Can a distinction be
+drawn between potential users in setting standards for reproduction? 
+Archival storage, use copies, browsing copies--ought an attempt to set
+standards even be made?  5) Finally, costs.  How much are we prepared to
+pay to capture absolute fidelity?  What are the trade-offs between vastly
+enhanced access, degrees of fidelity, and costs?
+
+These standards, BATTIN concluded, serve to complicate further the
+reproduction process, and add to the long list of technical standards
+that are necessary to ensure widespread access.  Ways to articulate and
+analyze the costs that are attached to the different levels of standards
+must be found.
+
+Given the chaos concerning standards, which promises to linger for the
+foreseeable future, BATTIN urged adoption of the following general
+principles:
+
+     * Strive to understand the changing information requirements of
+     scholarly disciplines as more and more technology is integrated into
+     the process of research and scholarly communication in order to meet
+     future scholarly needs, not to build for the past.  Capture
+     deteriorating information at the highest affordable resolution, even
+     though the dissemination and display technologies will lag.
+
+     * Develop cooperative mechanisms to foster agreement on protocols
+     for document structure and other interchange mechanisms necessary
+     for widespread dissemination and use before official standards are
+     set.
+
+     * Accept that, in a transition period, de facto standards will have
+     to be developed.
+
+     * Capture information in a way that keeps all options open and
+     provides for total convertibility:  OCR, scanning of microfilm,
+     producing microfilm from scanned documents, etc.
+
+     * Work closely with the generators of information and the builders
+     of networks and databases to ensure that continuing accessibility is
+     a primary concern from the beginning.
+

+HOOTON * Several questions to be considered in discussing text conversion
+*
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+HOOTON introduced the final topic, text conversion, by noting that it is
+becoming an increasingly important part of the imaging business.  Many
+people now realize that it enhances their system to be able to have more
+and more character data as part of their imaging system.  Re the issue of
+OCR versus rekeying, HOOTON posed several questions:  How does one get
+text into computer-readable form?  Does one use automated processes? 
+Does one attempt to eliminate the use of operators where possible? 
+Standards for accuracy, he said, are extremely important:  it makes a
+major difference in cost and time whether one sets as a standard 98.5
+percent acceptance or 99.5 percent.  He mentioned outsourcing as a
+possibility for converting text.  Finally, what one does with the image
+to prepare it for the recognition process is also important, he said,
+because such preparation changes how recognition is viewed, as well as
+facilitates recognition itself.

+LESK * Roles of participants in CORE * Data flow * The scanning process *
+The image interface * Results of experiments involving the use of
+electronic resources and traditional paper copies * Testing the issue of
+serendipity * Conclusions *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Michael LESK, executive director, Computer Science Research, Bell
+Communications Research, Inc. (Bellcore), discussed the Chemical Online
+Retrieval Experiment (CORE), a cooperative project involving Cornell
+University, OCLC, Bellcore, and the American Chemical Society (ACS).
+
+LESK spoke on 1) how the scanning was performed, including the unusual
+feature of page segmentation, and 2) the use made of the text and the
+image in experiments.
+
+Working with the chemistry journals (because ACS has been saving its
+typesetting tapes since the mid-1970s and thus has a significant back-run
+of the most important chemistry journals in the United States), CORE is
+attempting to create an automated chemical library.  Approximately a
+quarter of the pages by square inch are made up of images of
+quasi-pictorial material; dealing with the graphic components of the
+pages is extremely important.  LESK described the roles of participants
+in CORE:  1) ACS provides copyright permission, journals on paper,
+journals on microfilm, and some of the definitions of the files; 2) at
+Bellcore, LESK chiefly performs the data preparation, while Dennis Egan
+performs experiments on the users of chemical abstracts, and supplies the
+indexing and numerous magnetic tapes;  3) Cornell provides the site of the
+experiment; 4) OCLC develops retrieval software and other user interfaces.
+Various manufacturers and publishers have furnished other help.
+
+Concerning data flow, Bellcore receives microfilm and paper from ACS; the
+microfilm is scanned by outside vendors, while the paper is scanned
+inhouse on an Improvision scanner, twenty pages per minute at 300 dpi,
+which provides sufficient quality for all practical uses.  LESK would
+prefer to have more gray level, because one of the ACS journals prints on
+some colored pages, which creates a problem.
+
+Bellcore performs all this scanning, creates a page-image file, and also
+selects from the pages the graphics, to mix with the text file (which is
+discussed later in the Workshop).  The user is always searching the ASCII
+file, but she or he may see a display based on the ASCII or a display
+based on the images.
+
+LESK illustrated how the program performs page analysis, and the image
+interface.  (The user types several words, is presented with a list--
+usually of the titles of articles contained in an issue--that derives
+from the ASCII, clicks on an icon and receives an image that mirrors an
+ACS page.)  LESK also illustrated an alternative interface, based on text
+on the ASCII, the so-called SuperBook interface from Bellcore.
+
+LESK next presented the results of an experiment conducted by Dennis Egan
+and involving thirty-six students at Cornell, one third of them
+undergraduate chemistry majors, one third senior undergraduate chemistry
+majors, and one third graduate chemistry students.  A third of them
+received the paper journals, the traditional paper copies and chemical
+abstracts on paper.  A third received image displays of the pictures of
+the pages, and a third received the text display with pop-up graphics.
+
+The students were given several questions made up by some chemistry
+professors.  The questions fell into five classes, ranging from very easy
+to very difficult, and included questions designed to simulate browsing
+as well as a traditional information retrieval-type task.
+
+LESK furnished the following results.  In the straightforward question
+search--the question being, what is the phosphorus oxygen bond distance
+and hydroxy phosphate?--the students were told that they could take
+fifteen minutes and, then, if they wished, give up.  The students with
+paper took more than fifteen minutes on average, and yet most of them
+gave up.  The students with either electronic format, text or image,
+received good scores in reasonable time, hardly ever had to give up, and
+usually found the right answer.
+
+In the browsing study, the students were given a list of eight topics,
+told to imagine that an issue of the Journal of the American Chemical
+Society had just appeared on their desks, and were also told to flip
+through it and to find topics mentioned in the issue.  The average scores
+were about the same.  (The students were told to answer yes or no about
+whether or not particular topics appeared.)  The errors, however, were
+quite different.  The students with paper rarely said that something
+appeared when it had not.  But they often failed to find something
+actually mentioned in the issue.  The computer people found numerous
+things, but they also frequently said that a topic was mentioned when it
+was not.  (The reason, of course, was that they were performing word
+searches.  They were finding that words were mentioned and they were
+concluding that they had accomplished their task.)
+
+This question also contained a trick to test the issue of serendipity. 
+The students were given another list of eight topics and instructed,
+without taking a second look at the journal, to recall how many of this
+new list of eight topics were in this particular issue.  This was an
+attempt to see if they performed better at remembering what they were not
+looking for.  They all performed about the same, paper or electronics,
+about 62 percent accurate.  In short, LESK said, people were not very
+good when it came to serendipity, but they were no worse at it with
+computers than they were with paper.
+
+(LESK gave a parenthetical illustration of the learning curve of students
+who used SuperBook.)
+
+The students using the electronic systems started off worse than the ones
+using print, but by the third of the three sessions in the series had
+caught up to print.  As one might expect, electronics provide a much
+better means of finding what one wants to read; reading speeds, once the
+object of the search has been found, are about the same.
+
+Almost none of the students could perform the hard task--the analogous
+transformation.  (It would require the expertise of organic chemists to
+complete.)  But an interesting result was that the students using the text
+search performed terribly, while those using the image system did best.
+That the text search system is driven by text offers the explanation.
+Everything is focused on the text; to see the pictures, one must press
+on an icon.  Many students found the right article containing the answer
+to the question, but they did not click on the icon to bring up the right
+figure and see it.  They did not know that they had found the right place,
+and thus got it wrong.
+
+The short answer demonstrated by this experiment was that in the event
+one does not know what to read, one needs the electronic systems; the
+electronic systems hold no advantage at the moment if one knows what to
+read, but neither do they impose a penalty.
+
+LESK concluded by commenting that, on one hand, the image system was easy
+to use.  On the other hand, the text display system, which represented
+twenty man-years of work in programming and polishing, was not winning,
+because the text was not being read, just searched.  The much easier
+system is highly competitive as well as remarkably effective for the
+actual chemists.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+To Ricky ERWAY, associate coordinator, American Memory, Library of
+Congress, the constant variety of conversion projects taking place
+simultaneously represented perhaps the most challenging aspect of working
+on AM.  Thus, the challenge was not to find a solution for text
+conversion but a tool kit of solutions to apply to LC's varied
+collections that need to be converted.  ERWAY limited her remarks to the
+process of converting text to machine-readable form, and the variety of
+LC's text collections, for example, bound volumes, microfilm, and
+handwritten manuscripts.
+
+Two assumptions have guided AM's approach, ERWAY said:  1) A desire not
+to perform the conversion inhouse.  Because of the variety of formats and
+types of texts, to capitalize the equipment and have the talents and
+skills to operate them at LC would be extremely expensive.  Further, the
+natural inclination to upgrade to newer and better equipment each year
+made it reasonable for AM to focus on what it did best and seek external
+conversion services.  Using service bureaus also allowed AM to have
+several types of operations take place at the same time.  2) AM was not a
+technology project, but an effort to improve access to library
+collections.  Hence, whether text was converted using OCR or rekeying
+mattered little to AM.  What mattered were cost and accuracy of results.
+
+AM considered different types of service bureaus and selected three to
+perform several small tests in order to acquire a sense of the field. 
+The sample collections with which they worked included handwritten
+correspondence, typewritten manuscripts from the 1940s, and
+eighteenth-century printed broadsides on microfilm.  On none of these
+samples was OCR performed; they were all rekeyed.  AM had several special
+requirements for the three service bureaus it had engaged.  For instance,
+any errors in the original text were to be retained.  Working from bound
+volumes or anything that could not be sheet-fed also constituted a factor
+eliminating companies that would have performed OCR.
+
+AM requires 99.95 percent accuracy, which, though it sounds high, often
+means one or two errors per page.  The initial batch of test samples
+contained several handwritten materials for which AM did not require
+text-coding.  The results, ERWAY reported, were in all cases fairly
+comparable:  for the most part, all three service bureaus achieved 99.95
+percent accuracy.  AM was satisfied with the work but surprised at the cost.
+
+As AM began converting whole collections, it retained the requirement for
+99.95 percent accuracy and added requirements for text-coding.  AM needed
+to begin performing work more than three years ago before LC requirements
+for SGML applications had been established.  Since AM's goal was simply
+to retain any of the intellectual content represented by the formatting
+of the document (which would be lost if one performed a straight ASCII
+conversion), AM used "SGML-like" codes.  These codes resembled SGML tags
+but were used without the benefit of document-type definitions.  AM found
+that many service bureaus were not yet SGML-proficient.
+
+Additional factors influencing the approach AM took with respect to
+coding included:  1) the inability of any known microcomputer-based
+user-retrieval software to take advantage of SGML coding; and 2) the
+multiple inconsistencies in format of the older documents, which
+confirmed AM in its desire not to attempt to force the different formats
+to conform to a single document-type definition (DTD) and thus create the
+need for a separate DTD for each document. 
+
+The five text collections that AM has converted or is in the process of
+converting include a collection of eighteenth-century broadsides, a
+collection of pamphlets, two typescript document collections, and a
+collection of 150 books.
+
+ERWAY next reviewed the results of AM's experience with rekeying, noting
+again that because the bulk of AM's materials are historical, the quality
+of the text often does not lend itself to OCR.  While non-English
+speakers are less likely to guess or elaborate or correct typos in the
+original text, they are also less able to infer what we would; they also
+are nearly incapable of converting handwritten text.  Another
+disadvantage of working with overseas keyers is that they are much less
+likely to telephone with questions, especially on the coding, with the
+result that they develop their own rules as they encounter new
+situations.
+
+Government contracting procedures and time frames posed a major challenge
+to performing the conversion.  Many service bureaus are not accustomed to
+retaining the image, even if they perform OCR.  Thus, questions of image
+format and storage media were somewhat novel to many of them.  ERWAY also
+remarked other problems in dealing with service bureaus, for example,
+their inability to perform text conversion from the kind of microfilm
+that LC uses for preservation purposes.
+
+But quality control, in ERWAY's experience, was the most time-consuming
+aspect of contracting out conversion.  AM has been attempting to perform
+a 10-percent quality review, looking at either every tenth document or
+every tenth page to make certain that the service bureaus are maintaining
+99.95 percent accuracy.  But even if they are complying with the
+requirement for accuracy, finding errors produces a desire to correct
+them and, in turn, to clean up the whole collection, which defeats the
+purpose to some extent.  Even a double entry requires a
+character-by-character comparison to the original to meet the accuracy
+requirement.  LC is not accustomed to publish imperfect texts, which
+makes attempting to deal with the industry standard an emotionally
+fraught issue for AM.  As was mentioned in the previous day's discussion,
+going from 99.95 to 99.99 percent accuracy usually doubles costs and
+means a third keying or another complete run-through of the text.
+
+Although AM has learned much from its experiences with various collections
+and various service bureaus, ERWAY concluded pessimistically that no
+breakthrough has been achieved.   Incremental improvements have occurred
+in some of the OCR technology, some of the processes, and some of the
+standards acceptances, which, though they may lead to somewhat lower costs,
+do not offer much encouragement to many people who are anxiously awaiting
+the day that the entire contents of LC are available on-line.

+ZIDAR * Several answers to why one attempts to perform full-text
+conversion * Per page cost of performing OCR * Typical problems
+encountered during editing * Editing poor copy OCR vs. rekeying *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Judith ZIDAR, coordinator, National Agricultural Text Digitizing Program
+(NATDP), National Agricultural Library (NAL), offered several answers to
+the question of why one attempts to perform full-text conversion:  1)
+Text in an image can be read by a human but not by a computer, so of
+course it is not searchable and there is not much one can do with it.  2)
+Some material simply requires word-level access.  For instance, the legal
+profession insists on full-text access to its material; with taxonomic or
+geographic material, which entails numerous names, one virtually requires
+word-level access.  3) Full text permits rapid browsing and searching,
+something that cannot be achieved in an image with today's technology. 
+4) Text stored as ASCII and delivered in ASCII is standardized and highly
+portable.  5) People just want full-text searching, even those who do not
+know how to do it.  NAL, for the most part, is performing OCR at an
+actual cost per average-size page of approximately $7.  NAL scans the
+page to create the electronic image and passes it through the OCR device.
+
+ZIDAR next rehearsed several typical problems encountered during editing. 
+Praising the celerity of her student workers, ZIDAR observed that editing
+requires approximately five to ten minutes per page, assuming that there
+are no large tables to audit.  Confusion among the three characters I, 1, 
+and l, constitutes perhaps the most common problem encountered.  Zeroes
+and  O's also are  frequently confused.  Double M's create a particular
+problem, even on clean pages.  They are so wide in most fonts that they
+touch, and the system simply cannot tell where one letter ends and the
+other begins.  Complex page formats occasionally fail to columnate
+properly, which entails rescanning as though one were working with a
+single column, entering the ASCII, and decolumnating for better
+searching.  With proportionally spaced text, OCR can have difficulty
+discerning what is a space and what are merely spaces between letters, as
+opposed to spaces between words, and therefore will merge text or break
+up words where it should not.
+
+ZIDAR said that it can often take longer to edit a poor-copy OCR than to
+key it from scratch.  NAL has also experimented with partial editing of
+text, whereby project workers go into and clean up the format, removing
+stray characters but not running a spell-check.  NAL corrects typos in
+the title and authors' names, which provides a foothold for searching and
+browsing.  Even extremely poor-quality OCR (e.g., 60-percent accuracy)
+can still be searched, because numerous words are correct, while the
+important words are probably repeated often enough that they are likely
+to be found correct somewhere.  Librarians, however, cannot tolerate this
+situation, though end users seem more willing to use this text for
+searching, provided that NAL indicates that it is unedited.  ZIDAR
+concluded that rekeying of text may be the best route to take, in spite
+of numerous problems with quality control and cost.
+

+DISCUSSION * Modifying an image before performing OCR * NAL's costs per
+page *AM's costs per page and experience with Federal Prison Industries *
+Elements comprising NATDP's costs per page * OCR and structured markup *
+Distinction between the structure of a document and its representation
+when put on the screen or printed *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+HOOTON prefaced the lengthy discussion that followed with several
+comments about modifying an image before one reaches the point of
+performing OCR.  For example, in regard to an application containing a
+significant amount of redundant data, such as form-type data, numerous
+companies today are working on various kinds of form renewal, prior to
+going through a recognition process, by using dropout colors.  Thus,
+acquiring access to form design or using electronic means are worth
+considering.  HOOTON also noted that conversion usually makes or breaks
+one's imaging system.  It is extremely important, extremely costly in
+terms of either capital investment or service, and determines the quality
+of the remainder of one's system, because it determines the character of
+the raw material used by the system.
+
+Concerning the four projects undertaken by NAL, two inside and two
+performed by outside contractors, ZIDAR revealed that an in-house service
+bureau executed the first at a cost between $8 and $10 per page for
+everything, including building of the database.  The project undertaken
+by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
+cost approximately $10 per page for the conversion, plus some expenses
+for the software and building of the database.  The Acid Rain Project--a
+two-disk set produced by the University of Vermont, consisting of
+Canadian publications on acid rain--cost $6.70 per page for everything,
+including keying of the text, which was double keyed, scanning of the
+images, and building of the database.  The in-house project offered
+considerable ease of convenience and greater control of the process.  On
+the other hand, the service bureaus know their job and perform it
+expeditiously, because they have more people.
+
+As a useful comparison, ERWAY revealed AM's costs as follows:  $0.75
+cents to $0.85 cents per thousand characters, with an average page
+containing 2,700 characters.  Requirements for coding and imaging
+increase the costs.  Thus, conversion of the text, including the coding,
+costs approximately $3 per page.  (This figure does not include the
+imaging and database-building included in the NAL costs.)  AM also
+enjoyed a happy experience with Federal Prison Industries, which
+precluded the necessity of going through the request-for-proposal process
+to award a contract, because it is another government agency.  The
+prisoners performed AM's rekeying just as well as other service bureaus
+and proved handy as well.  AM shipped them the books, which they would
+photocopy on a book-edge scanner.  They would perform the markup on
+photocopies, return the books as soon as they were done with them,
+perform the keying, and return the material to AM on WORM disks.
+
+ZIDAR detailed the elements that constitute the previously noted cost of
+approximately $7 per page.  Most significant is the editing, correction
+of errors, and spell-checkings, which though they may sound easy to
+perform require, in fact, a great deal of time.  Reformatting text also
+takes a while, but a significant amount of NAL's expenses are for equipment,
+which was extremely expensive when purchased because it was one of the few
+systems on the market.  The costs of equipment are being amortized over
+five years but are still quite high, nearly $2,000 per month.
+
+HOCKEY raised a general question concerning OCR and the amount of editing
+required (substantial in her experience) to generate the kind of
+structured markup necessary for manipulating the text on the computer or
+loading it into any retrieval system.  She wondered if the speakers could
+extend the previous question about the cost-benefit of adding or exerting
+structured markup.  ERWAY noted that several OCR systems retain italics,
+bolding, and other spatial formatting.  While the material may not be in
+the format desired, these systems possess the ability to remove the
+original materials quickly from the hands of the people performing the
+conversion, as well as to retain that information so that users can work
+with it.  HOCKEY rejoined that the current thinking on markup is that one
+should not say that something is italic or bold so much as why it is that
+way.  To be sure, one needs to know that something was italicized, but
+how can one get from one to the other?  One can map from the structure to
+the typographic representation.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER suggested that, given the 100 million items the Library
+holds, it may not be possible for LC to do more than report that a thing
+was in italics as opposed to why it was italics, although that may be
+desirable in some contexts.  Promising to talk a bit during the afternoon
+session about several experiments OCLC performed on automatic recognition
+of document elements, and which they hoped to extend, WEIBEL said that in
+fact one can recognize the major elements of a document with a fairly
+high degree of reliability, at least as good as OCR.  STEVENS drew a
+useful distinction between standard, generalized markup (i.e., defining
+for a document-type definition the structure of the document), and what
+he termed a style sheet, which had to do with italics, bolding, and other
+forms of emphasis.  Thus, two different components are at work, one being
+the structure of the document itself (its logic), and the other being its
+representation when it is put on the screen or printed.

+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+HOCKEY * Text in ASCII and the representation of electronic text versus
+an image * The need to look at ways of using markup to assist retrieval *
+The need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Susan HOCKEY, director, Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities
+(CETH), Rutgers and Princeton Universities, announced that one talk
+(WEIBEL's) was moved into this session from the morning and that David
+Packard was unable to attend.  The session would attempt to focus more on
+what one can do with a text in ASCII and the representation of electronic
+text rather than just an image, what one can do with a computer that
+cannot be done with a book or an image.  It would be argued that one can
+do much more than just read a text, and from that starting point one can
+use markup and methods of preparing the text to take full advantage of
+the capability of the computer.  That would lead to a discussion of what
+the European Community calls REUSABILITY, what may better be termed
+DURABILITY, that is, how to prepare or make a text that will last a long
+time and that can be used for as many applications as possible, which
+would lead to issues of improving intellectual access.
+
+HOCKEY urged the need to look at ways of using markup to facilitate retrieval,
+not just for referencing or to help locate an item that is retrieved, but also to put markup tags in
+a text to help retrieve the thing sought either with linguistic tagging or
+interpretation.  HOCKEY also argued that little advancement had occurred in
+the software tools currently available for retrieving and searching text.
+She pressed the desideratum of going beyond Boolean searches and performing
+more sophisticated searching, which the insertion of more markup in the text
+would facilitate.  Thinking about electronic texts as opposed to images means
+considering material that will never appear in print form, or print will not
+be its primary form, that is, material which only appears in electronic form.
+HOCKEY alluded to the history and the need for markup and tagging and
+electronic text, which was developed through the use of computers in the
+humanities; as MICHELSON had observed, Father Busa had started in 1949
+to prepare the first-ever text on the computer.
+
+HOCKEY remarked several large projects, particularly in Europe, for the
+compilation of dictionaries, language studies, and language analysis, in
+which people have built up archives of text and have begun to recognize
+the need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional,
+that can be used not just to print the text, which may be assumed to be a
+byproduct of what one wants to do, but to structure it inside the computer
+so that it can be searched, built into a Hypertext system, etc.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Stuart WEIBEL, senior research scientist, Online Computer Library Center,
+Inc. (OCLC), described OCLC's approach to preparing electronic text.  He
+argued that the electronic world into which we are moving must
+accommodate not only the future but the past as well, and to some degree
+even the present.  Thus, starting out at one end with retroconversion and
+keying of texts, one would like to move toward much more automated ways
+of developing data.
+
+For example, Project ADAPT had to do with automatically converting
+document images into a structured document database with OCR text as
+indexing and also a little bit of automatic formatting and tagging of
+that text.  The CORE project hosted by Cornell University, Bellcore,
+OCLC, the American Chemical Society, and Chemical Abstracts, constitutes
+WEIBEL's principal concern at the moment.  This project is an example of
+converting text for which one already has a machine-readable version into
+a format more suitable for electronic delivery and database searching. 
+(Since Michael LESK had previously described CORE, WEIBEL would say
+little concerning it.)  Borrowing a chemical phrase, de novo synthesis,
+WEIBEL cited the Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials as an example
+of de novo electronic publishing, that is, a form in which the primary
+form of the information is electronic.
+
+Project ADAPT, then, which OCLC completed a couple of years ago and in
+fact is about to resume, is a model in which one takes page images either
+in paper or microfilm and converts them automatically to a searchable
+electronic database, either on-line or local.  The operating assumption
+is that accepting some blemishes in the data, especially for
+retroconversion of materials, will make it possible to accomplish more. 
+Not enough money is available to support perfect conversion.
+
+WEIBEL related several steps taken to perform image preprocessing
+(processing on the image before performing optical character
+recognition), as well as image postprocessing.  He denied the existence
+of intelligent character recognition and asserted that what is wanted is
+page recognition, which is a long way off.  OCLC has experimented with
+merging of multiple optical character recognition systems that will
+reduce errors from an unacceptable rate of 5 characters out of every
+l,000 to an unacceptable rate of 2 characters out of every l,000, but it
+is not good enough.  It will never be perfect.
+
+Concerning the CORE Project, WEIBEL observed that Bellcore is taking the
+topography files, extracting the page images, and converting those
+topography files to SGML markup.  LESK hands that data off to OCLC, which
+builds that data into a Newton database, the same system that underlies
+the on-line system in virtually all of the reference products at OCLC. 
+The long-term goal is to make the systems interoperable so that not just
+Bellcore's system and OCLC's system can access this data, but other
+systems can as well, and the key to that is the Z39.50 common command
+language and the full-text extension.  Z39.50 is fine for MARC records,
+but is not enough to do it for full text (that is, make full texts
+interoperable).
+
+WEIBEL next outlined the critical role of SGML for a variety of purposes,
+for example, as noted by HOCKEY, in the world of extremely large
+databases, using highly structured data to perform field searches. 
+WEIBEL argued that by building the structure of the data in (i.e., the
+structure of the data originally on a printed page), it becomes easy to
+look at a journal article even if one cannot read the characters and know
+where the title or author is, or what the sections of that document would be.
+OCLC wants to make that structure explicit in the database, because it will
+be important for retrieval purposes.
+
+The second big advantage of SGML is that it gives one the ability to
+build structure into the database that can be used for display purposes
+without contaminating the data with instructions about how to format
+things.  The distinction lies between procedural markup, which tells one
+where to put dots on the page, and descriptive markup, which describes
+the elements of a document.
+
+WEIBEL believes that there should be no procedural markup in the data at
+all, that the data should be completely unsullied by information about
+italics or boldness.  That should be left up to the display device,
+whether that display device is a page printer or a screen display device. 
+By keeping one's database free of that kind of contamination, one can
+make decisions down the road, for example, reorganize the data in ways
+that are not cramped by built-in notions of what should be italic and
+what should be bold.  WEIBEL strongly advocated descriptive markup.  As
+an example, he illustrated the index structure in the CORE data.  With
+subsequent illustrated examples of markup, WEIBEL acknowledged the common
+complaint that SGML is hard to read in its native form, although markup
+decreases considerably once one gets into the body.  Without the markup,
+however, one would not have the structure in the data.  One can pass
+markup through a LaTeX processor and convert it relatively easily to a
+printed version of the document.
+
+WEIBEL next illustrated an extremely cluttered screen dump of OCLC's
+system, in order to show as much as possible the inherent capability on
+the screen.  (He noted parenthetically that he had become a supporter of
+X-Windows as a result of the progress of the CORE Project.)  WEIBEL also
+illustrated the two major parts of the interface:  l) a control box that
+allows one to generate lists of items, which resembles a small table of
+contents based on key words one wishes to search, and 2) a document
+viewer, which is a separate process in and of itself.  He demonstrated
+how to follow links through the electronic database simply by selecting
+the appropriate button and bringing them up.  He also noted problems that
+remain to be accommodated in the interface (e.g., as pointed out by LESK,
+what happens when users do not click on the icon for the figure).
+
+Given the constraints of time, WEIBEL omitted a large number of ancillary
+items in order to say a few words concerning storage requirements and
+what will be required to put a lot of things on line.  Since it is
+extremely expensive to reconvert all of this data, especially if it is
+just in paper form (and even if it is in electronic form in typesetting
+tapes), he advocated building journals electronically from the start.  In
+that case, if one only has text graphics and indexing (which is all that
+one needs with de novo electronic publishing, because there is no need to
+go back and look at bit-maps of pages), one can get 10,000 journals of
+full text, or almost 6 million pages per year.  These pages can be put in
+approximately 135 gigabytes of storage, which is not all that much,
+WEIBEL said.  For twenty years, something less than three terabytes would
+be required.  WEIBEL calculated the costs of storing this information as
+follows:  If a gigabyte costs approximately $1,000, then a terabyte costs
+approximately $1 million to buy in terms of hardware.  One also needs a
+building to put it in and a staff like OCLC to handle that information. 
+So, to support a terabyte, multiply by five, which gives $5 million per
+year for a supported terabyte of data.

+DISCUSSION * Tapes saved by ACS are the typography files originally
+supporting publication of the journal * Cost of building tagged text into
+the database *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+During the question-and-answer period that followed WEIBEL's
+presentation, these clarifications emerged.  The tapes saved by the
+American Chemical Society are the typography files that originally
+supported the publication of the journal.  Although they are not tagged
+in SGML, they are tagged in very fine detail.  Every single sentence is
+marked, all the registry numbers, all the publications issues, dates, and
+volumes.  No cost figures on tagging material on a per-megabyte basis
+were available.  Because ACS's typesetting system runs from tagged text,
+there is no extra cost per article.  It was unknown what it costs ACS to
+keyboard the tagged text rather than just keyboard the text in the
+cheapest process.  In other words, since one intends to publish things
+and will need to build tagged text into a typography system in any case,
+if one does that in such a way that it can drive not only typography but
+an electronic system (which is what ACS intends to do--move to SGML
+publishing), the marginal cost is zero.  The marginal cost represents the
+cost of building tagged text into the database, which is small.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Prior to speaking about SGML and markup, Michael SPERBERG-McQUEEN, editor,
+Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), University of Illinois-Chicago, first drew
+a distinction between texts and computers:  Texts are abstract cultural
+and linguistic objects while computers are complicated physical devices,
+he said.  Abstract objects cannot be placed inside physical devices; with
+computers one can only represent text and act upon those representations.
+
+The recognition that all representation is encoding, SPERBERG-McQUEEN
+argued, leads to the recognition of two things:  1) The topic description
+for this session is slightly misleading, because there can be no discussion
+of pros and cons of text-coding unless what one means is pros and cons of
+working with text with computers.  2) No text can be represented in a
+computer without some sort of encoding; images are one way of encoding text,
+ASCII is another, SGML yet another.  There is no encoding without some
+information loss, that is, there is no perfect reproduction of a text that
+allows one to do away with the original.  Thus, the question becomes,
+What is the most useful representation of text for a serious work?
+This depends on what kind of serious work one is talking about.
+
+The projects demonstrated the previous day all involved highly complex
+information and fairly complex manipulation of the textual material.
+In order to use that complicated information, one has to calculate it
+slowly or manually and store the result.  It needs to be stored, therefore,
+as part of one's representation of the text.  Thus, one needs to store the
+structure in the text.  To deal with complicated representations of text,
+one needs somehow to control the complexity of the representation of a text;
+that means one needs a way of finding out whether a document and an
+electronic representation of a document is legal or not; and that
+means one needs a grammar of documents.
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN discussed the variety of forms of formal grammars,
+implicit and explicit, as applied to text, and their capabilities.  He
+argued that these grammars correspond to different models of text that
+different developers have.  For example, one implicit model of the text
+is that there is no internal structure, but just one thing after another,
+a few characters and then perhaps a start-title command, and then a few
+more characters and an end-title command.  SPERBERG-McQUEEN also
+distinguished several kinds of text that have a sort of hierarchical
+structure that is not very well defined, which, typically, corresponds
+to grammars that are not very well defined, as well as hierarchies that
+are very well defined (e.g., the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae) and extremely
+complicated things such as SGML, which handle strictly hierarchical data
+very nicely.
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN conceded that one other model not illustrated on his two
+displays was the model of text as a bit-mapped image, an image of a page,
+and confessed to having been converted to a limited extent by the
+Workshop to the view that electronic images constitute a promising,
+probably superior alternative to microfilming.  But he was not convinced
+that electronic images represent a serious attempt to represent text in
+electronic form.  Many of their problems stem from the fact that they are
+not direct attempts to represent the text but attempts to represent the
+page, thus making them representations of representations.
+
+In this situation of increasingly complicated textual information and the
+need to control that complexity in a useful way (which begs the question
+of the need for good textual grammars), one has the introduction of SGML. 
+With SGML, one can develop specific document-type declarations
+for specific text types or, as with the TEI, attempts to generate
+general document-type declarations that can handle all sorts of text.
+The TEI is an attempt to develop formats for text representation that
+will ensure the kind of reusability and longevity of data discussed earlier.
+It offers a way to stay alive in the state of permanent technological
+revolution.
+
+It has been a continuing challenge in the TEI to create document grammars
+that do some work in controlling the complexity of the textual object but
+also allowing one to represent the real text that one will find. 
+Fundamental to the notion of the TEI is that TEI conformance allows one
+the ability to extend or modify the TEI tag set so that it fits the text
+that one is attempting to represent.
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN next outlined the administrative background of the TEI. 
+The TEI is an international project to develop and disseminate guidelines
+for the encoding and interchange of machine-readable text.  It is
+sponsored by the Association for Computers in the Humanities, the
+Association for Computational Linguistics, and the Association for
+Literary and Linguistic Computing.  Representatives of numerous other
+professional societies sit on its advisory board.  The TEI has a number
+of affiliated projects that have provided assistance by testing drafts of
+the guidelines.
+
+Among the design goals for the TEI tag set, the scheme first of all must
+meet the needs of research, because the TEI came out of the research
+community, which did not feel adequately served by existing tag sets. 
+The tag set must be extensive as well as compatible with existing and
+emerging standards.  In 1990, version 1.0 of the Guidelines was released
+(SPERBERG-McQUEEN illustrated their contents).
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN noted that one problem besetting electronic text has
+been the lack of adequate internal or external documentation for many
+existing electronic texts.  The TEI guidelines as currently formulated
+contain few fixed requirements, but one of them is this:  There must
+always be a document header, an in-file SGML tag that provides
+1) a bibliographic description of the electronic object one is talking
+about (that is, who included it, when, what for, and under which title);
+and 2) the copy text from which it was derived, if any.  If there was
+no copy text or if the copy text is unknown, then one states as much.
+Version 2.0 of the Guidelines was scheduled to be completed in fall 1992
+and a revised third version is to be presented to the TEI advisory board
+for its endorsement this coming winter.  The TEI itself exists to provide
+a markup language, not a marked-up text.
+
+Among the challenges the TEI has attempted to face is the need for a
+markup language that will work for existing projects, that is, handle the
+level of markup that people are using now to tag only chapter, section,
+and paragraph divisions and not much else.  At the same time, such a
+language also will be able to scale up gracefully to handle the highly
+detailed markup which many people foresee as the future destination of
+much electronic text, and which is not the future destination but the
+present home of numerous electronic texts in specialized areas.
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN dismissed the lowest-common-denominator approach as
+unable to support the kind of applications that draw people who have
+never been in the public library regularly before, and make them come
+back.  He advocated more interesting text and more intelligent text. 
+Asserting that it is not beyond economic feasibility to have good texts,
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN noted that the TEI Guidelines listing 200-odd tags
+contains tags that one is expected to enter every time the relevant
+textual feature occurs.  It contains all the tags that people need now,
+and it is not expected that everyone will tag things in the same way.
+
+The question of how people will tag the text is in large part a function
+of their reaction to what SPERBERG-McQUEEN termed the issue of
+reproducibility.  What one needs to be able to reproduce are the things
+one wants to work with.  Perhaps a more useful concept than that of
+reproducibility or recoverability is that of processability, that is,
+what can one get from an electronic text without reading it again
+in the original.  He illustrated this contention with a page from
+Jan Comenius's bilingual Introduction to Latin.
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN returned at length to the issue of images as simulacra
+for the text, in order to reiterate his belief that in the long run more
+than images of pages of particular editions of the text are needed,
+because just as second-generation photocopies and second-generation
+microfilm degenerate, so second-generation representations tend to
+degenerate, and one tends to overstress some relatively trivial aspects
+of the text such as its layout on the page, which is not always
+significant, despite what the text critics might say, and slight other
+pieces of information such as the very important lexical ties between the
+English and Latin versions of Comenius's bilingual text, for example. 
+Moreover, in many crucial respects it is easy to fool oneself concerning
+what a scanned image of the text will accomplish.  For example, in order
+to study the transmission of texts, information concerning the text
+carrier is necessary, which scanned images simply do not always handle. 
+Further, even the high-quality materials being produced at Cornell use
+much of the information that one would need if studying those books as
+physical objects.  It is a choice that has been made.  It is an arguably
+justifiable choice, but one does not know what color those pen strokes in
+the margin are or whether there was a stain on the page, because it has
+been filtered out.  One does not know whether there were rips in the page
+because they do not show up, and on a couple of the marginal marks one
+loses half of the mark because the pen is very light and the scanner
+failed to pick it up, and so what is clearly a checkmark in the margin of
+the original becomes a little scoop in the margin of the facsimile. 
+Standard problems for facsimile editions, not new to electronics, but
+also true of light-lens photography, and are remarked here because it is
+important that we not fool ourselves that even if we produce a very nice
+image of this page with good contrast, we are not replacing the
+manuscript any more than microfilm has replaced the manuscript.
+
+The TEI comes from the research community, where its first allegiance
+lies, but it is not just an academic exercise.  It has relevance far
+beyond those who spend all of their time studying text, because one's
+model of text determines what one's software can do with a text.  Good
+models lead to good software.  Bad models lead to bad software.  That has
+economic consequences, and it is these economic consequences that have
+led the European Community to help support the TEI, and that will lead,
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN hoped, some software vendors to realize that if they
+provide software with a better model of the text they can make a killing.

+DISCUSSION * Implications of different DTDs and tag sets * ODA versus SGML *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+During the discussion that followed, several additional points were made. 
+Neither AAP (i.e., Association of American Publishers) nor CALS (i.e.,
+Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support) has a document-type
+definition for ancient Greek drama, although the TEI will be able to
+handle that.  Given this state of affairs and assuming that the
+technical-journal producers and the commercial vendors decide to use the
+other two types, then an institution like the Library of Congress, which
+might receive all of their publications, would have to be able to handle
+three different types of document definitions and tag sets and be able to
+distinguish among them.
+
+Office Document Architecture (ODA) has some advantages that flow from its
+tight focus on office documents and clear directions for implementation. 
+Much of the ODA standard is easier to read and clearer at first reading
+than the SGML standard, which is extremely general.  What that means is
+that if one wants to use graphics in TIFF and ODA, one is stuck, because
+ODA defines graphics formats while TIFF does not, whereas SGML says the
+world is not waiting for this work group to create another graphics format.
+What is needed is an ability to use whatever graphics format one wants.
+
+The TEI provides a socket that allows one to connect the SGML document to
+the graphics.  The notation that the graphics are in is clearly a choice
+that one needs to make based on her or his environment, and that is one
+advantage.  SGML is less megalomaniacal in attempting to define formats
+for all kinds of information, though more megalomaniacal in attempting to
+cover all sorts of documents.  The other advantage is that the model of
+text represented by SGML is simply an order of magnitude richer and more
+flexible than the model of text offered by ODA.  Both offer hierarchical
+structures, but SGML recognizes that the hierarchical model of the text
+that one is looking at may not have been in the minds of the designers,
+whereas ODA does not.
+
+ODA is not really aiming for the kind of document that the TEI wants to
+encompass.  The TEI can handle the kind of material ODA has, as well as a
+significantly broader range of material.  ODA seems to be very much
+focused on office documents, which is what it started out being called--
+office document architecture.

+CALALUCA * Text-encoding from a publisher's perspective *
+Responsibilities of a publisher * Reproduction of Migne's Latin series
+whole and complete with SGML tags based on perceived need and expected
+use * Particular decisions arising from the general decision to produce
+and publish PLD *
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+The final speaker in this session, Eric CALALUCA, vice president,
+Chadwyck-Healey, Inc., spoke from the perspective of a publisher re
+text-encoding, rather than as one qualified to discuss methods of
+encoding data, and observed that the presenters sitting in the room,
+whether they had chosen to or not, were acting as publishers:  making
+choices, gathering data, gathering information, and making assessments. 
+CALALUCA offered the hard-won conviction that in publishing very large
+text files (such as PLD), one cannot avoid making personal judgments of
+appropriateness and structure.
+
+In CALALUCA's view, encoding decisions stem from prior judgments.  Two
+notions have become axioms for him in the consideration of future sources
+for electronic publication:  1) electronic text publishing is as personal
+as any other kind of publishing, and questions of if and how to encode
+the data are simply a consequence of that prior decision;  2) all
+personal decisions are open to criticism, which is unavoidable.
+
+CALALUCA rehearsed his role as a publisher or, better, as an intermediary
+between what is viewed as a sound idea and the people who would make use
+of it.  Finding the specialist to advise in this process is the core of
+that function.  The publisher must monitor and hug the fine line between
+giving users what they want and suggesting what they might need.  One
+responsibility of a publisher is to represent the desires of scholars and
+research librarians as opposed to bullheadedly forcing them into areas
+they would not choose to enter.
+
+CALALUCA likened the questions being raised today about data structure
+and standards to the decisions faced by the Abbe Migne himself during
+production of the Patrologia series in the mid-nineteenth century. 
+Chadwyck-Healey's decision to reproduce Migne's Latin series whole and
+complete with SGML tags was also based upon a perceived need and an
+expected use.  In the same way that Migne's work came to be far more than
+a simple handbook for clerics, PLD is already far more than a database
+for theologians.  It is a bedrock source for the study of Western
+civilization, CALALUCA asserted.
+
+In regard to the decision to produce and publish PLD, the editorial board
+offered direct judgments on the question of appropriateness of these
+texts for conversion, their encoding and their distribution, and
+concluded that the best possible project was one that avoided overt
+intrusions or exclusions in so important a resource.  Thus, the general
+decision to transmit the original collection as clearly as possible with
+the widest possible avenues for use led to other decisions:  1) To encode
+the data or not, SGML or not, TEI or not.  Again, the expected user
+community asserted the need for normative tagging structures of important
+humanities texts, and the TEI seemed the most appropriate structure for
+that purpose.  Research librarians, who are trained to view the larger
+impact of electronic text sources on 80 or 90 or 100 doctoral
+disciplines, loudly approved the decision to include tagging.  They see
+what is coming better than the specialist who is completely focused on
+one edition of Ambrose's De Anima, and they also understand that the
+potential uses exceed present expectations.  2) What will be tagged and
+what will not.  Once again, the board realized that one must tag the
+obvious.  But in no way should one attempt to identify through encoding
+schemes every single discrete area of a text that might someday be
+searched.  That was another decision.  Searching by a column number, an
+author, a word, a volume, permitting combination searches, and tagging
+notations seemed logical choices as core elements.  3) How does one make
+the data available?  Tieing it to a CD-ROM edition creates limitations,
+but a magnetic tape file that is very large, is accompanied by the
+encoding specifications, and that allows one to make local modifications
+also allows one to incorporate any changes one may desire within the
+bounds of private research, though exporting tag files from a CD-ROM
+could serve just as well.  Since no one on the board could possibly
+anticipate each and every way in which a scholar might choose to mine
+this data bank, it was decided to satisfy the basics and make some
+provisions for what might come.  4) Not to encode the database would rob
+it of the interchangeability and portability these important texts should
+accommodate.  For CALALUCA, the extensive options presented by full-text
+searching require care in text selection and strongly support encoding of
+data to facilitate the widest possible search strategies.  Better
+software can always be created, but summoning the resources, the people,
+and the energy to reconvert the text is another matter.
+
+PLD is being encoded, captured, and distributed, because to
+Chadwyck-Healey and the board it offers the widest possible array of
+future research applications that can be seen today.  CALALUCA concluded
+by urging the encoding of all important text sources in whatever way
+seems most appropriate and durable at the time, without blanching at the
+thought that one's work may require emendation in the future.  (Thus,
+Chadwyck-Healey produced a very large humanities text database before the
+final release of the TEI Guidelines.)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+HOCKEY prefaced the discussion that followed with several comments in
+favor of creating texts with markup and on trends in encoding.  In the
+future, when many more texts are available for on-line searching, real
+problems in finding what is wanted will develop, if one is faced with
+millions of words of data.  It therefore becomes important to consider
+putting markup in texts to help searchers home in on the actual things
+they wish to retrieve.  Various approaches to refining retrieval methods
+toward this end include building on a computer version of a dictionary
+and letting the computer look up words in it to obtain more information
+about the semantic structure or semantic field of a word, its grammatical
+structure, and syntactic structure.
+
+HOCKEY commented on the present keen interest in the encoding world
+in creating:  1) machine-readable versions of dictionaries that can be
+initially tagged in SGML, which gives a structure to the dictionary entry;
+these entries can then be converted into a more rigid or otherwise
+different database structure inside the computer, which can be treated as
+a dynamic tool for searching mechanisms; 2) large bodies of text to study
+the language.  In order to incorporate more sophisticated mechanisms,
+more about how words behave needs to be known, which can be learned in
+part from information in dictionaries.  However, the last ten years have
+seen much interest in studying the structure of printed dictionaries
+converted into computer-readable form.  The information one derives about
+many words from those is only partial, one or two definitions of the
+common or the usual meaning of a word, and then numerous definitions of
+unusual usages.  If the computer is using a dictionary to help retrieve
+words in a text, it needs much more information about the common usages,
+because those are the ones that occur over and over again.  Hence the
+current interest in developing large bodies of text in computer-readable
+form in order to study the language.  Several projects are engaged in
+compiling, for example, 100 million words. HOCKEY described one with
+which she was associated briefly at Oxford University involving
+compilation of 100 million words of British English:  about 10 percent of
+that will contain detailed linguistic tagging encoded in SGML; it will
+have word class taggings, with words identified as nouns, verbs,
+adjectives, or other parts of speech.  This tagging can then be used by
+programs which will begin to learn a bit more about the structure of the
+language, and then, can go to tag more text.
+
+HOCKEY said that the more that is tagged accurately, the more one can
+refine the tagging process and thus the bigger body of text one can build
+up with linguistic tagging incorporated into it.  Hence, the more tagging
+or annotation there is in the text, the more one may begin to learn about
+language and the more it will help accomplish more intelligent OCR.  She
+recommended the development of software tools that will help one begin to
+understand more about a text, which can then be applied to scanning
+images of that text in that format and to using more intelligence to help
+one interpret or understand the text.
+
+HOCKEY posited the need to think about common methods of text-encoding
+for a long time to come, because building these large bodies of text is
+extremely expensive and will only be done once.
+
+In the more general discussion on approaches to encoding that followed,
+these points were made:
+
+BESSER identified the underlying problem with standards that all have to
+struggle with in adopting a standard, namely, the tension between a very
+highly defined standard that is very interchangeable but does not work
+for everyone because something is lacking, and a standard that is less
+defined, more open, more adaptable, but less interchangeable.  Contending
+that the way in which people use SGML is not sufficiently defined, BESSER
+wondered 1) if people resist the TEI because they think it is too defined
+in certain things they do not fit into, and 2) how progress with
+interchangeability can be made without frightening people away.
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN replied that the published drafts of the TEI had met
+with surprisingly little objection on the grounds that they do not allow
+one to handle X or Y or Z.  Particular concerns of the affiliated
+projects have led, in practice, to discussions of how extensions are to
+be made; the primary concern of any project has to be how it can be
+represented locally, thus making interchange secondary.  The TEI has
+received much criticism based on the notion that everything in it is
+required or even recommended, which, as it happens, is a misconception
+from the beginning,   because none of it is required and very little is
+actually actively recommended for all cases, except that one document
+one's source.
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN agreed with BESSER about this trade-off:  all the
+projects in a set of twenty TEI-conformant projects will not necessarily
+tag the material in the same way.  One result of the TEI will be that the
+easiest problems will be solved--those dealing with the external form of
+the information; but the problem that is hardest in interchange is that
+one is not encoding what another wants, and vice versa.  Thus, after
+the adoption of a common notation, the differences in the underlying
+conceptions of what is interesting about texts become more visible.
+The success of a standard like the TEI will lie in the ability of
+the recipient of interchanged texts to use some of what it contains
+and to add the information that was not encoded that one wants, in a
+layered way, so that texts can be gradually enriched and one does not
+have to put in everything all at once.  Hence, having a well-behaved
+markup scheme is important.
+
+STEVENS followed up on the paradoxical analogy that BESSER alluded to in
+the example of the MARC records, namely, the formats that are the same
+except that they are different.  STEVENS drew a parallel between
+document-type definitions and MARC records for books and serials and maps,
+where one has a tagging structure and there is a text-interchange. 
+STEVENS opined that the producers of the information will set the terms
+for the standard (i.e., develop document-type definitions for the users
+of their products), creating a situation that will be problematical for
+an institution like the Library of Congress, which will have to deal with
+the DTDs in the event that a multiplicity of them develops.  Thus,
+numerous people are seeking a standard but cannot find the tag set that
+will be acceptable to them and their clients.  SPERBERG-McQUEEN agreed
+with this view, and said that the situation was in a way worse:  attempting
+to unify arbitrary DTDs resembled attempting to unify a MARC record with a
+bibliographic record done according to the Prussian instructions. 
+According to STEVENS, this situation occurred very early in the process.
+
+WATERS recalled from early discussions on Project Open Book the concern
+of many people that merely by producing images, POB was not really
+enhancing intellectual access to the material.  Nevertheless, not wishing
+to overemphasize the opposition between imaging and full text, WATERS
+stated that POB views getting the images as a first step toward possibly
+converting to full text through character recognition, if the technology
+is appropriate.  WATERS also emphasized that encoding is involved even
+with a set of images.
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN agreed with WATERS that one can create an SGML document
+consisting wholly of images.  At first sight, organizing graphic images
+with an SGML document may not seem to offer great advantages, but the
+advantages of the scheme WATERS described would be precisely that
+ability to move into something that is more of a multimedia document:
+a combination of transcribed text and page images.  WEIBEL concurred in
+this judgment, offering evidence from Project ADAPT, where a page is
+divided into text elements and graphic elements, and in fact the text
+elements are organized by columns and lines.  These lines may be used as
+the basis for distributing documents in a network environment.  As one
+develops software intelligent enough to recognize what those elements
+are, it makes sense to apply SGML to an image initially, that may, in
+fact, ultimately become more and more text, either through OCR or edited
+OCR or even just through keying.  For WATERS, the labor of composing the
+document and saying this set of documents or this set of images belongs
+to this document constitutes a significant investment.
+
+WEIBEL also made the point that the AAP tag sets, while not excessively
+prescriptive, offer a common starting point; they do not define the
+structure of the documents, though.  They have some recommendations about
+DTDs one could use as examples, but they do just suggest tag sets.   For
+example, the CORE project attempts to use the AAP markup as much as
+possible, but there are clearly areas where structure must be added. 
+That in no way contradicts the use of AAP tag sets.
+
+SPERBERG-McQUEEN noted that the TEI prepared a long working paper early
+on about the AAP tag set and what it lacked that the TEI thought it
+needed, and a fairly long critique of the naming conventions, which has
+led to a very different style of naming in the TEI.  He stressed the
+importance of the opposition between prescriptive markup, the kind that a
+publisher or anybody can do when producing documents de novo, and
+descriptive markup, in which one has to take what the text carrier
+provides.  In these particular tag sets it is easy to overemphasize this
+opposition, because the AAP tag set is extremely flexible.  Even if one
+just used the DTDs, they allow almost anything to appear almost anywhere.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+Marybeth PETERS, policy planning adviser to the Register of Copyrights,
+Library of Congress,   made several general comments and then opened the
+floor to discussion of subjects of interest to the audience.
+
+Having attended several sessions in an effort to gain a sense of what
+people did and where copyright would affect their lives, PETERS expressed
+the following cautions:
+
+     * If one takes and converts materials and puts them in new forms,
+     then, from a copyright point of view, one is creating something and
+     will receive some rights.
+
+     * However, if what one is converting already exists, a question
+     immediately arises about the status of the materials in question.
+
+     * Putting something in the public domain in the United States offers
+     some freedom from anxiety, but distributing it throughout the world
+     on a network is another matter, even if one has put it in the public
+     domain in the United States.  Re foreign laws, very frequently a
+     work can be in the public domain in the United States but protected
+     in other countries.  Thus, one must consider all of the places a
+     work may reach, lest one unwittingly become liable to being faced
+     with a suit for copyright infringement, or at least a letter
+     demanding discussion of what one is doing.
+
+PETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States.  The U.S.
+Constitution effectively states that Congress has the power to enact
+copyright laws for two purposes:  1) to encourage the creation and
+dissemination of intellectual works for the good of society as a whole;
+and, significantly, 2) to give creators and those who package and
+disseminate materials the economic rewards that are due them.
+
+Congress strives to strike a balance, which at times can become an
+emotional issue.  The United States has never accepted the notion of the
+natural right of an author so much as it has accepted the notion of the
+public good and the desirability of incentives to promote it.  This state
+of affairs, however, has created strains on the international level and
+is the reason for several of the differences in the laws that we have. 
+Today the United States protects almost every kind of work that can be
+called an expression of an author.  The standard for gaining copyright
+protection is simply originality.  This is a low standard and means that
+a work is not copied from something else, as well as shows a certain
+minimal amount of authorship.  One can also acquire copyright protection
+for making a new version of preexisting material, provided it manifests
+some spark of creativity.
+
+However, copyright does not protect ideas, methods, systems--only the way
+that one expresses those things.  Nor does copyright protect anything
+that is mechanical, anything that does not involve choice, or criteria
+concerning whether or not one should do a thing.  For example, the
+results of a process called declicking, in which one mechanically removes
+impure sounds from old recordings, are not copyrightable.  On the other
+hand, the choice to record a song digitally and to increase the sound of
+violins or to bring up the tympani constitutes the results of conversion
+that are copyrightable.  Moreover, if a work is protected by copyright in
+the United States, one generally needs the permission of the copyright
+owner to convert it.  Normally, who will own the new--that is, converted-
+-material is a matter of contract.  In the absence of a contract, the
+person who creates the new material is the author and owner.  But people
+do not generally think about the copyright implications until after the
+fact.  PETERS stressed the need when dealing with copyrighted works to
+think about copyright in advance.  One's bargaining power is much greater
+up front than it is down the road.
+
+PETERS next discussed works not protected by copyright, for example, any
+work done by a federal employee as part of his or her official duties is
+in the public domain in the United States.  The issue is not wholly free
+of doubt concerning whether or not the work is in the public domain
+outside the United States.  Other materials in the public domain include: 
+any works published more than seventy-five years ago, and any work
+published in the United States more than twenty-eight years ago, whose
+copyright was not renewed.  In talking about the new technology and
+putting material in a digital form to send all over the world, PETERS
+cautioned, one must keep in mind that while the rights may not be an
+issue in the United States, they may be in different parts of the world,
+where most countries previously employed a copyright term of the life of
+the author plus fifty years.
+
+PETERS next reviewed the economics of copyright holding.  Simply,
+economic rights are the rights to control the reproduction of a work in
+any form.  They belong to the author, or in the case of a work made for
+hire, the employer.  The second right, which is critical to conversion,
+is the right to change a work.  The right to make new versions is perhaps
+one of the most significant rights of authors, particularly in an
+electronic world.  The third right is the right to publish the work and
+the right to disseminate it, something that everyone who deals in an
+electronic medium needs to know.  The basic rule is if a copy is sold,
+all rights of distribution are extinguished with the sale of that copy. 
+The key is that it must be sold.  A number of companies overcome this
+obstacle by leasing or renting their product.  These companies argue that
+if the material is rented or leased and not sold, they control the uses
+of a work.  The fourth right, and one very important in a digital world,
+is a right of public performance, which means the right to show the work
+sequentially.  For example, copyright owners control the showing of a
+CD-ROM product in a public place such as a public library.  The reverse
+side of public performance is something called the right of public
+display.  Moral rights also exist, which at the federal level apply only
+to very limited visual works of art, but in theory may apply under
+contract and other principles.  Moral rights may include the right of an
+author to have his or her name on a work, the right of attribution, and
+the right to object to distortion or mutilation--the right of integrity.
+
+The way copyright law is worded gives much latitude to activities such as
+preservation; to use of material for scholarly and research purposes when
+the user does not make multiple copies; and to the generation of
+facsimile copies of unpublished works by libraries for themselves and
+other libraries.  But the law does not allow anyone to become the
+distributor of the product for the entire world.  In today's electronic
+environment, publishers are extremely concerned that the entire world is
+networked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a
+single library.  Hence, if there is to be only one sale, which publishers
+may choose to live with, they will obtain their money in other ways, for
+example, from access and use.  Hence, the development of site licenses
+and other kinds of agreements to cover what publishers believe they
+should be compensated for.  Any solution that the United States takes
+today has to consider the international arena.
+
+Noting that the United States is a member of the Berne Convention and
+subscribes to its provisions, PETERS described the permissions process. 
+She also defined compulsory licenses.  A compulsory license, of which the
+United States has had a few, builds into the law the right to use a work
+subject to certain terms and conditions.  In the international arena,
+however, the ability to use compulsory licenses is extremely limited. 
+Thus, clearinghouses and other collectives comprise one option that has
+succeeded in providing for use of a work.  Often overlooked when one
+begins to use copyrighted material and put products together is how
+expensive the permissions process and managing it is.  According to
+PETERS, the price of copyright in a digital medium, whatever solution is
+worked out, will include managing and assembling the database.  She
+strongly recommended that publishers and librarians or people with
+various backgrounds cooperate to work out administratively feasible
+systems, in order to produce better results.
+
+In the lengthy question-and-answer period that followed PETERS's
+presentation, the following points emerged:
+
+     * The Copyright Office maintains that anything mechanical and
+     totally exhaustive probably is not protected.  In the event that
+     what an individual did in developing potentially copyrightable
+     material is not understood, the Copyright Office will ask about the
+     creative choices the applicant chose to make or not to make.  As a
+     practical matter, if one believes she or he has made enough of those
+     choices, that person has a right to assert a copyright and someone
+     else must assert that the work is not copyrightable.  The more
+     mechanical, the more automatic, a thing is, the less likely it is to
+     be copyrightable.
+
+     * Nearly all photographs are deemed to be copyrightable, but no one
+     worries about them much, because everyone is free to take the same
+     image.  Thus, a photographic copyright represents what is called a
+     "thin" copyright.  The photograph itself must be duplicated, in
+     order for copyright to be violated.
+
+     * The Copyright Office takes the position that X-rays are not
+     copyrightable because they are mechanical.  It  can be argued
+     whether or not image enhancement in scanning can be protected.  One
+     must exercise care with material created with public funds and
+     generally in the public domain.  An article written by a federal
+     employee, if written as part of official duties, is not
+     copyrightable.  However, control over a scientific article written
+     by a National Institutes of Health grantee (i.e., someone who
+     receives money from the U.S. government), depends on NIH policy.  If
+     the government agency has no policy (and that policy can be
+     contained in its regulations, the contract, or the grant), the
+     author retains copyright.  If a provision of the contract, grant, or
+     regulation states that there will be no copyright, then it does not
+     exist.  When a work is created, copyright automatically comes into
+     existence unless something exists that says it does not.
+
+     * An enhanced electronic copy of a print copy of an older reference
+     work in the public domain that does not contain copyrightable new
+     material is a purely mechanical rendition of the original work, and
+     is not copyrightable.
+
+     * Usually, when a work enters the public domain, nothing can remove
+     it.  For example, Congress recently passed into law the concept of
+     automatic renewal, which means that copyright on any work published
+     between l964 and l978 does not have to be renewed in order to
+     receive a seventy-five-year term.  But any work not renewed before
+     1964 is in the public domain.
+
+     * Concerning whether or not the United States keeps track of when
+     authors die, nothing was ever done, nor is anything being done at
+     the moment by the Copyright Office.
+
+     * Software that drives a mechanical process is itself copyrightable. 
+     If one changes platforms, the software itself has a copyright.  The
+     World Intellectual Property Organization will hold a symposium 28
+     March through 2 April l993, at Harvard University, on digital
+     technology, and will study this entire issue.  If one purchases a
+     computer software package, such as MacPaint, and creates something
+     new, one receives protection only for that which has been added.
+
+PETERS added that often in copyright matters, rough justice is the
+outcome, for example, in collective licensing, ASCAP (i.e., American
+Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers), and BMI (i.e., Broadcast
+Music, Inc.), where it may seem that the big guys receive more than their
+due.  Of course, people ought not to copy a creative product without
+paying for it; there should be some compensation.  But the truth of the
+world, and it is not a great truth, is that the big guy gets played on
+the radio more frequently than the little guy, who has to do much more
+until he becomes a big guy.  That is true of every author, every
+composer, everyone, and, unfortunately, is part of life.
+
+Copyright always originates with the author, except in cases of works
+made for hire.  (Most software falls into this category.)  When an author
+sends his article to a journal, he has not relinquished copyright, though
+he retains the right to relinquish it.  The author receives absolutely
+everything.  The less prominent the author, the more leverage the
+publisher will have in contract negotiations.  In order to transfer the
+rights, the author must sign an agreement giving them away.
+
+In an electronic society, it is important to be able to license a writer
+and work out deals.  With regard to use of a work, it usually is much
+easier when a publisher holds the rights.  In an electronic era, a real
+problem arises when one is digitizing and making information available. 
+PETERS referred again to electronic licensing clearinghouses.  Copyright
+ought to remain with the author, but as one moves forward globally in the
+electronic arena, a middleman who can handle the various rights becomes
+increasingly necessary.
+
+The notion of copyright law is that it resides with the individual, but
+in an on-line environment, where a work can be adapted and tinkered with
+by many individuals, there is concern.  If changes are authorized and
+there is no agreement to the contrary, the person who changes a work owns
+the changes.  To put it another way, the person who acquires permission
+to change a work technically will become the author and the owner, unless
+some agreement to the contrary has been made.  It is typical for the
+original publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the
+uses.  Copyright law always only sets up the boundaries.  Anything can be
+changed by contract.

+
+In his role as moderator of the concluding session, GIFFORD raised two
+questions he believed would benefit from discussion:  1) Are there enough
+commonalities among those of us that have been here for two days so that
+we can see courses of action that should be taken in the future?  And, if
+so, what are they and who might take them?  2) Partly derivative from
+that, but obviously very dangerous to LC as host, do you see a role for
+the Library of Congress in all this?  Of course, the Library of Congress
+holds a rather special status in a number of these matters, because it is
+not perceived as a player with an economic stake in them, but are there
+roles that LC can play that can help advance us toward where we are heading?
+
+Describing himself as an uninformed observer of the technicalities of the
+last two days, GIFFORD detected three different emphases in the Workshop: 
+1) people who are very deeply committed to text; 2) people who are almost
+passionate about images; and 3) a few people who are very committed to
+what happens to the networks.  In other words, the new networking
+dimension, the accessibility of the processability, the portability of
+all this across the networks.  How do we pull those three together?
+
+Adding a question that reflected HOCKEY's comment that this was the
+fourth workshop she had attended in the previous thirty days, FLEISCHHAUER
+wondered to what extent this meeting had reinvented the wheel, or if it
+had contributed anything in the way of bringing together a different group
+of people from those who normally appear on the workshop circuit.
+
+HOCKEY confessed to being struck at this meeting and the one the
+Electronic Pierce Consortium organized the previous week that this was a
+coming together of people working on texts and not images.  Attempting to
+bring the two together is something we ought to be thinking about for the
+future:  How one can think about working with image material to begin
+with, but structuring it and digitizing it in such a way that at a later
+stage it can be interpreted into text, and find a common way of building
+text and images together so that they can be used jointly in the future,
+with the network support to begin there because that is how people will
+want to access it.
+
+In planning the long-term development of something, which is what is
+being done in electronic text, HOCKEY stressed the importance not only
+of discussing the technical aspects of how one does it but particularly
+of thinking about what the people who use the stuff will want to do.
+But conversely, there are numerous things that people start to do with
+electronic text or material that nobody ever thought of in the beginning.
+
+LESK, in response to the question concerning the role of the Library of
+Congress, remarked the often suggested desideratum of having electronic
+deposit:  Since everything is now computer-typeset, an entire decade of
+material that was machine-readable exists, but the publishers frequently
+did not save it; has LC taken any action to have its copyright deposit
+operation start collecting these machine-readable versions?  In the
+absence of PETERS, GIFFORD replied that the question was being
+actively considered but that that was only one dimension of the problem.
+Another dimension is the whole question of the integrity of the original
+electronic document.  It becomes highly important in science to prove
+authorship.  How will that be done?
+
+ERWAY explained that, under the old policy, to make a claim for a
+copyright for works that were published in electronic form, including
+software, one had to submit a paper copy of the first and last twenty
+pages of code--something that represented the work but did not include
+the entire work itself and had little value to anyone.  As a temporary
+measure, LC has claimed the right to demand electronic versions of
+electronic publications.  This measure entails a proactive role for the
+Library to say that it wants a particular electronic version.  Publishers
+then have perhaps a year to submit it.  But the real problem for LC is
+what to do with all this material in all these different formats.  Will
+the Library mount it?  How will it give people access to it?  How does LC
+keep track of the appropriate computers, software, and media?  The situation
+is so hard to control, ERWAY said, that it makes sense for each publishing
+house to maintain its own archive.  But LC cannot enforce that either.
+
+GIFFORD acknowledged LESK's suggestion that establishing a priority
+offered the solution, albeit a fairly complicated one.  But who maintains
+that register?, he asked.  GRABER noted that LC does attempt to collect a
+Macintosh version and the IBM-compatible version of software.  It does
+not collect other versions.  But while true for software, BYRUM observed,
+this reply does not speak to materials, that is, all the materials that
+were published that were on somebody's microcomputer or driver tapes
+at a publishing office across the country.  LC does well to acquire
+specific machine-readable products selectively that were intended to be
+machine-readable.  Materials that were in machine-readable form at one time,
+BYRUM said, would be beyond LC's capability at the moment, insofar as
+attempting to acquire, organize, and preserve them are concerned--and
+preservation would be the most important consideration.  In this
+connection, GIFFORD reiterated the need to work out some sense of
+distributive responsibility for a number of these issues, which
+inevitably will require significant cooperation and discussion.
+Nobody can do it all.
+
+LESK suggested that some publishers may look with favor on LC beginning
+to serve as a depository of tapes in an electronic manuscript standard. 
+Publishers may view this as a service that they did not have to perform
+and they might send in tapes.  However, SPERBERG-McQUEEN countered,
+although publishers have had equivalent services available to them for a
+long time, the electronic text archive has never turned away or been
+flooded with tapes and is forever sending feedback to the depositor. 
+Some publishers do send in tapes.
+
+ANDRE viewed this discussion as an allusion to the issue of standards. 
+She recommended that the AAP standard and the TEI, which has already been
+somewhat harmonized internationally and which also shares several
+compatibilities with the AAP, be harmonized to ensure sufficient
+compatibility in the software.  She drew the line at saying LC ought to
+be the locus or forum for such harmonization.
+
+Taking the group in a slightly different direction, but one where at
+least in the near term LC might play a helpful role, LYNCH remarked the
+plans of a number of projects to carry out preservation by creating
+digital images that will end up in on-line or near-line storage at some
+institution.   Presumably, LC will link this material somehow to its
+on-line catalog in most cases.  Thus, it is in a digital form.  LYNCH had
+the impression that many of these institutions would be willing to make
+those files accessible to other people outside the institution, provided
+that there is no copyright problem.  This desideratum will require
+propagating the knowledge that those digitized files exist, so that they
+can end up in other on-line catalogs.  Although uncertain about the
+mechanism for achieving this result, LYNCH said that it warranted
+scrutiny because it seemed to be connected to some of the basic issues of
+cataloging and distribution of records.  It would be  foolish, given the
+amount of work that all of us have to do and our meager resources, to
+discover multiple institutions digitizing the same work.  Re microforms,
+LYNCH said, we are in pretty good shape.
+
+BATTIN called this a big problem and noted that the Cornell people (who
+had already departed) were working on it.  At issue from the beginning
+was to learn how to catalog that information into RLIN and then into
+OCLC, so that it would be accessible.  That issue remains to be resolved. 
+LYNCH rejoined that putting it into OCLC or RLIN was helpful insofar as
+somebody who is thinking of performing preservation activity on that work
+could learn about it.  It is not necessarily helpful for institutions to
+make that available.  BATTIN opined that the idea was that it not only be
+for preservation purposes but for the convenience of people looking for
+this material.  She endorsed LYNCH's dictum that duplication of this
+effort was to be avoided by every means.
+
+HOCKEY informed the Workshop about one major current activity of CETH,
+namely a catalogue of machine-readable texts in the humanities.  Held on
+RLIN at present, the catalogue has been concentrated on ASCII as opposed
+to digitized images of text.  She is exploring ways to improve the
+catalogue and make it more widely available, and welcomed suggestions
+about these concerns.  CETH owns the records, which are not just
+restricted to RLIN, and can distribute them however it wishes.
+
+Taking up LESK's earlier question, BATTIN inquired whether LC, since it
+is accepting electronic files and designing a mechanism for dealing with
+that rather than putting books on shelves, would become responsible for
+the National Copyright Depository of Electronic Materials.  Of course
+that could not be accomplished overnight, but it would be something LC
+could plan for.  GIFFORD acknowledged that much thought was being devoted
+to that set of problems and returned the discussion to the issue raised
+by LYNCH--whether or not putting the kind of records that both BATTIN and
+HOCKEY have been talking about in RLIN is not a satisfactory solution. 
+It seemed to him that RLIN answered LYNCH's original point concerning
+some kind of directory for these kinds of materials.  In a situation
+where somebody is attempting to decide whether or not to scan this or
+film that or to learn whether or not someone has already done so, LYNCH
+suggested, RLIN is helpful, but it is not helpful in the case of a local,
+on-line catalogue.  Further, one would like to have her or his system be
+aware that that exists in digital form, so that one can present it to a
+patron, even though one did not digitize it, if it is out of copyright. 
+The only way to make those linkages would be to perform a tremendous
+amount of real-time look-up, which would be awkward at best, or
+periodically to yank the whole file from RLIN and match it against one's
+own stuff, which is a nuisance.
+
+But where, ERWAY inquired, does one stop including things that are
+available with Internet, for instance, in one's local catalogue?
+It almost seems that that is LC's means to acquire access to them.
+That represents LC's new form of library loan.  Perhaps LC's new on-line
+catalogue is an amalgamation of all these catalogues on line.  LYNCH
+conceded that perhaps that was true in the very long term, but was not
+applicable to scanning in the short term.  In his view, the totals cited
+by Yale, 10,000 books over perhaps a four-year period, and 1,000-1,500
+books from Cornell, were not big numbers, while searching all over
+creation for relatively rare occurrences will prove to be less efficient. 
+As GIFFORD wondered if this would not be a separable file on RLIN and
+could be requested from them, BATTIN interjected that it was easily
+accessible to an institution.  SEVERTSON pointed out that that file, cum
+enhancements, was available with reference information on CD-ROM, which
+makes it a little more available.
+
+In HOCKEY's view, the real question facing the Workshop is what to put in
+this catalogue, because that raises the question of what constitutes a
+publication in the electronic world.  (WEIBEL interjected that Eric Joule
+in OCLC's Office of Research is also wrestling with this particular
+problem, while GIFFORD thought it sounded fairly generic.)  HOCKEY
+contended that a majority of texts in the humanities are in the hands
+of either a small number of large research institutions or individuals
+and are not generally available for anyone else to access at all.
+She wondered if these texts ought to be catalogued.
+
+After argument proceeded back and forth for several minutes over why
+cataloguing might be a necessary service, LEBRON suggested that this
+issue involved the responsibility of a publisher.  The fact that someone
+has created something electronically and keeps it under his or her
+control does not constitute publication.  Publication implies
+dissemination.  While it would be important for a scholar to let other
+people know that this creation exists, in many respects this is no
+different from an unpublished manuscript.  That is what is being accessed
+in there, except that now one is not looking at it in the hard-copy but
+in the electronic environment.
+
+LEBRON expressed puzzlement at the variety of ways electronic publishing
+has been viewed.  Much of what has been discussed throughout these two
+days has concerned CD-ROM publishing, whereas in the on-line environment
+that she confronts, the constraints and challenges are very different. 
+Sooner or later LC will have to deal with the concept of on-line
+publishing.  Taking up the comment ERWAY made earlier about storing
+copies, LEBRON gave her own journal as an example.  How would she deposit
+OJCCT for copyright?, she asked, because the journal will exist in the
+mainframe at OCLC and people will be able to access it.  Here the
+situation is different, ownership versus access, and is something that
+arises with publication in the on-line environment, faster than is
+sometimes realized.  Lacking clear answers to all of these questions
+herself, LEBRON did not anticipate that LC would be able to take a role
+in helping to define some of them for quite a while.
+
+GREENFIELD observed that LC's Network Development Office is attempting,
+among other things, to explore the limits of MARC as a standard in terms
+of handling electronic information.  GREENFIELD also noted that Rebecca
+GUENTHER from that office gave a paper to the American Society for
+Information Science (ASIS) summarizing several of the discussion papers
+that were coming out of the Network Development Office.  GREENFIELD said
+he understood that that office had a list-server soliciting just the kind
+of feedback received today concerning the difficulties of identifying and
+cataloguing electronic information.  GREENFIELD hoped that everybody
+would be aware of that and somehow contribute to that conversation.
+
+Noting two of LC's roles, first, to act as a repository of record for
+material that is copyrighted in this country, and second, to make
+materials it holds available in some limited form to a clientele that
+goes beyond Congress, BESSER suggested that it was incumbent on LC to
+extend those responsibilities to all the things being published in
+electronic form.  This would mean eventually accepting electronic
+formats.  LC could require that at some point they be in a certain
+limited set of formats, and then develop mechanisms for allowing people
+to access those in the same way that other things are accessed.  This
+does not imply that they are on the network and available to everyone. 
+LC does that with most of its bibliographic records, BESSER said, which
+end up migrating to the utility (e.g., OCLC) or somewhere else.  But just
+as most of LC's books are available in some form through interlibrary
+loan or some other mechanism, so in the same way electronic formats ought
+to be available to others in some format, though with some copyright
+considerations.  BESSER was not suggesting that these mechanisms be
+established tomorrow, only that they seemed to fall within LC's purview,
+and that there should be long-range plans to establish them.
+
+Acknowledging that those from LC in the room agreed with BESSER
+concerning the need to confront difficult questions, GIFFORD underscored
+the magnitude of the problem of what to keep and what to select.  GIFFORD
+noted that LC currently receives some 31,000 items per day, not counting
+electronic materials, and argued for much more distributed responsibility
+in order to maintain and store electronic information.
+
+BESSER responded that the assembled group could be viewed as a starting
+point, whose initial operating premise could be helping to move in this
+direction and defining how LC could do so, for example, in areas of
+standardization or distribution of responsibility.
+
+FLEISCHHAUER added that AM was fully engaged, wrestling with some of the
+questions that pertain to the conversion of older historical materials,
+which would be one thing that the Library of Congress might do.  Several
+points mentioned by BESSER and several others on this question have a
+much greater impact on those who are concerned with cataloguing and the
+networking of bibliographic information, as well as preservation itself.
+
+Speaking directly to AM, which he considered was a largely uncopyrighted
+database, LYNCH urged development of a network version of AM, or
+consideration of making the data in it available to people interested in
+doing network multimedia.  On account of the current great shortage of
+digital data that is both appealing and unencumbered by complex rights
+problems, this course of action could have a significant effect on making
+network multimedia a reality.
+
+In this connection, FLEISCHHAUER reported on a fragmentary prototype in
+LC's Office of Information Technology Services that attempts to associate
+digital images of photographs with cataloguing information in ways that
+work within a local area network--a step, so to say, toward AM's
+construction of some sort of apparatus for access.  Further, AM has
+attempted to use standard data forms in order to help make that
+distinction between the access tools and the underlying data, and thus
+believes that the database is networkable.
+
+A delicate and agonizing policy question for LC, however, which comes
+back to resources and unfortunately has an impact on this, is to find
+some appropriate, honorable, and legal cost-recovery possibilities.  A
+certain skittishness concerning cost-recovery has made people unsure
+exactly what to do.  AM would be highly receptive to discussing further
+LYNCH's offer to test or demonstrate its database in a network
+environment, FLEISCHHAUER said.
+
+Returning the discussion to what she viewed as the vital issue of
+electronic deposit, BATTIN recommended that LC initiate a catalytic
+process in terms of distributed responsibility, that is, bring together
+the distributed organizations and set up a study group to look at all
+these issues and see where we as a nation should move.  The broader
+issues of how we deal with the management of electronic information will
+not disappear, but only grow worse.
+
+LESK took up this theme and suggested that LC attempt to persuade one
+major library in each state to deal with its state equivalent publisher,
+which might produce a cooperative project that would be equitably
+distributed around the country, and one in which LC would be dealing with
+a minimal number of publishers and minimal copyright problems.
+
+GRABER remarked the recent development in the scientific community of a
+willingness to use SGML and either deposit or interchange on a fairly
+standardized format.  He wondered if a similar movement was taking place
+in the humanities.  Although the National Library of Medicine found only
+a few publishers to cooperate in a like venture two or three years ago, a
+new effort might generate a much larger number willing to cooperate.
+
+KIMBALL recounted his unit's (Machine-Readable Collections Reading Room)
+troubles with the commercial publishers of electronic media in acquiring
+materials for LC's collections, in particular the publishers' fear that
+they would not be able to cover their costs and would lose control of
+their products, that LC would give them away or sell them and make
+profits from them.  He doubted that the publishing industry was prepared
+to move into this area at the moment, given its resistance to allowing LC
+to use its machine-readable materials as the Library would like.
+
+The copyright law now addresses compact disk as a medium, and LC can
+request one copy of that, or two copies if it is the only version, and
+can request copies of software, but that fails to address magazines or
+books or anything like that which is in machine-readable form.
+
+GIFFORD acknowledged the thorny nature of this issue, which he illustrated
+with the example of the cumbersome process involved in putting a copy of a
+scientific database on a LAN in LC's science reading room.  He also
+acknowledged that LC needs help and could enlist the energies and talents
+of Workshop participants in thinking through a number of these problems.
+
+GIFFORD returned the discussion to getting the image and text people to
+think through together where they want to go in the long term.  MYLONAS
+conceded that her experience at the Pierce Symposium the previous week at
+Georgetown University and this week at LC had forced her to reevaluate
+her perspective on the usefulness of text as images.  MYLONAS framed the
+issues in a series of questions:  How do we acquire machine-readable
+text?  Do we take pictures of it and perform OCR on it later?  Is it
+important to obtain very high-quality images and text, etc.? 
+FLEISCHHAUER agreed with MYLONAS's framing of strategic questions, adding
+that a large institution such as LC probably has to do all of those
+things at different times.  Thus, the trick is to exercise judgment.  The
+Workshop had added to his and AM's considerations in making those
+judgments.  Concerning future meetings or discussions, MYLONAS suggested
+that screening priorities would be helpful.
+
+WEIBEL opined that the diversity reflected in this group was a sign both
+of the health and of the immaturity of the field, and more time would
+have to pass before we convince one another concerning standards.
+
+An exchange between MYLONAS and BATTIN clarified the point that the
+driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects was
+the preservation of knowledge for the future, not simply for particular
+research use.  In the case of Perseus, MYLONAS said, the assumption was
+that the texts would not be entered again into electronically readable
+form.  SPERBERG-McQUEEN added that a scanned image would not serve as an
+archival copy for purposes of preservation in the case of, say, the Bill
+of Rights, in the sense that the scanned images are effectively the
+archival copies for the Cornell mathematics books.

+Avra MICHELSON           Forecasting the Use of Electronic Texts by
+                         Social Sciences and Humanities Scholars
+
+This presentation explores the ways in which electronic texts are likely
+to be used by the non-scientific scholarly community.  Many of the
+remarks are drawn from a report the speaker coauthored with Jeff
+Rothenberg, a computer scientist at The RAND Corporation.
+
+The speaker assesses 1) current scholarly use of information technology
+and 2) the key trends in information technology most relevant to the
+research process, in order to predict how social sciences and humanities
+scholars are apt to use electronic texts.  In introducing the topic,
+current use of electronic texts is explored broadly within the context of
+scholarly communication.  From the perspective of scholarly
+communication, the work of humanities and social sciences scholars
+involves five processes:  1) identification of sources, 2) communication
+with colleagues, 3) interpretation and analysis of data, 4) dissemination
+of research findings, and 5) curriculum development and instruction.  The
+extent to which computation currently permeates aspects of scholarly
+communication represents a viable indicator of the prospects for
+electronic texts.
+
+The discussion of current practice is balanced by an analysis of key
+trends in the scholarly use of information technology.  These include the
+trends toward end-user computing and connectivity, which provide a
+framework for forecasting the use of electronic texts through this
+millennium.  The presentation concludes with a summary of the ways in
+which the nonscientific scholarly community can be expected to use
+electronic texts, and the implications of that use for information
+providers.

+                                   Use of American Memory in Public and
+                                   School Libraries
+
+This joint discussion focuses on nonscholarly applications of electronic
+library materials, specifically addressing use of the Library of Congress
+American Memory (AM) program in a small number of public and school
+libraries throughout the United States.  AM consists of selected Library
+of Congress primary archival materials, stored on optical media
+(CD-ROM/videodisc), and presented with little or no editing.  Many
+collections are accompanied by electronic introductions and user's guides
+offering background information and historical context.  Collections
+represent a variety of formats including photographs, graphic arts,
+motion pictures, recorded sound, music, broadsides and manuscripts,
+books, and pamphlets.
+
+In 1991, the Library of Congress began a nationwide evaluation of AM in
+different types of institutions.  Test sites include public libraries,
+elementary and secondary school libraries, college and university
+libraries, state libraries, and special libraries.  Susan VECCIA and
+Joanne FREEMAN will discuss their observations on the use of AM by the
+nonscholarly community, using evidence gleaned from this ongoing
+evaluation effort.
+
+VECCIA will comment on the overall goals of the evaluation project, and
+the types of public and school libraries included in this study.  Her
+comments on nonscholarly use of AM will focus on the public library as a
+cultural and community institution, often bridging the gap between formal
+and informal education.  FREEMAN will discuss the use of AM in school
+libraries.  Use by students and teachers has revealed some broad
+questions about the use of electronic resources, as well as definite
+benefits gained by the "nonscholar."  Topics will include the problem of
+grasping content and context in an electronic environment, the stumbling
+blocks created by "new" technologies, and the unique skills and interests
+awakened through use of electronic resources.

+SESSION II
+
+Elli MYLONAS             The Perseus Project:  Interactive Sources and
+                         Studies in Classical Greece
+
+The Perseus Project (5) has just released Perseus 1.0, the first publicly
+available version of its hypertextual database of multimedia materials on
+classical Greece.  Perseus is designed to be used by a wide audience,
+comprised of readers at the student and scholar levels.  As such, it must
+be able to locate information using different strategies, and it must
+contain enough detail to serve the different needs of its users.  In
+addition, it must be delivered so that it is affordable to its target
+audience.  [These problems and the solutions we chose are described in
+Mylonas, "An Interface to Classical Greek Civilization," JASIS 43:2,
+March 1992.]
+
+In order to achieve its objective, the project staff decided to make a
+conscious separation between selecting and converting textual, database,
+and image data on the one hand, and putting it into a delivery system on
+the other.  That way, it is possible to create the electronic data
+without thinking about the restrictions of the delivery system.  We have
+made a great effort to choose system-independent formats for our data,
+and to put as much thought and work as possible into structuring it so
+that the translation from paper to electronic form will enhance the value
+of the data. [A discussion of these solutions as of two years ago is in
+Elli Mylonas, Gregory Crane, Kenneth Morrell, and D. Neel Smith, "The
+Perseus Project:  Data in the Electronic Age," in Accessing Antiquity: 
+The Computerization of Classical Databases, J. Solomon and T. Worthen
+(eds.),  University of Arizona Press, in press.]
+
+Much of the work on Perseus is focused on collecting and converting the
+data on which the project is based.  At the same time, it is necessary to
+provide means of access to the information, in order to make it usable,
+and them to investigate how it is used.  As we learn more about what
+students and scholars from different backgrounds do with Perseus, we can
+adjust our data collection, and also modify the system to accommodate
+them.  In creating a delivery system for general use, we have tried to
+avoid favoring any one type of use by allowing multiple forms of access
+to and navigation through the system.
+
+The way text is handled exemplifies some of these principles.  All text
+in Perseus is tagged using SGML, following the guidelines of the Text
+Encoding Initiative (TEI).  This markup is used to index the text, and
+process it so that it can be imported into HyperCard.  No SGML markup
+remains in the text that reaches the user, because currently it would be
+too expensive to create a system that acts on SGML in real time. 
+However, the regularity provided by SGML is essential for verifying the
+content of the texts, and greatly speeds all the processing performed on
+them.  The fact that the texts exist in SGML ensures that they will be
+relatively easy to port to different hardware and software, and so will
+outlast the current delivery platform.  Finally, the SGML markup
+incorporates existing canonical reference systems (chapter, verse, line,
+etc.); indexing and navigation are based on these features.  This ensures
+that the same canonical reference will always resolve to the same point
+within a text, and that all versions of our texts, regardless of delivery
+platform (even paper printouts) will function the same way.
+
+In order to provide tools for users, the text is processed by a
+morphological analyzer, and the results are stored in a database. 
+Together with the index, the Greek-English Lexicon, and the index of all
+the English words in the definitions of the lexicon, the morphological
+analyses comprise a set of linguistic tools that allow users of all
+levels to work with the textual information, and to accomplish different
+tasks.  For example, students who read no Greek may explore a concept as
+it appears in Greek texts by using the English-Greek index, and then
+looking up works in the texts and translations, or scholars may do
+detailed morphological studies of word use by using the morphological
+analyses of the texts.  Because these tools were not designed for any one
+use, the same tools and the same data can be used by both students and
+scholars.

+
+Chadwyck-Healey embarked last year on two distinct yet related full-text
+humanities database projects.
+
+The English Poetry Full-Text Database and the Patrologia Latina Database
+represent new approaches to linguistic research resources.  The size and
+complexity of the projects present problems for electronic publishers,
+but surmountable ones if they remain abreast of the latest possibilities
+in data capture and retrieval software techniques.
+
+The issues which required address prior to the commencement of the
+projects were legion:
+
+     1.   Editorial selection (or exclusion) of materials in each
+          database
+
+     2.   Deciding whether or not to incorporate a normative encoding
+          structure into the databases?
+               A.  If one is selected, should it be SGML?
+               B.  If SGML, then the TEI?
+     
+     3.   Deliver as CD-ROM, magnetic tape, or both?
+
+     4.   Can one produce retrieval software advanced enough for the
+          postdoctoral linguist, yet accessible enough for unattended
+          general use?  Should one try?
+
+     5.   Re fair and liberal networking policies, what are the risks to
+          an electronic publisher?
+
+     6.   How does the emergence of national and international education
+          networks affect the use and viability of research projects
+          requiring high investment?  Do the new European Community
+          directives concerning database protection necessitate two
+          distinct publishing projects, one for North America and one for
+          overseas?
+
+From new notions of "scholarly fair use" to the future of optical media,
+virtually every issue related to electronic publishing was aired.  The
+result is two projects which have been constructed to provide the quality
+research resources with the fewest encumbrances to use by teachers and
+private scholars.

+Dorothy TWOHIG
+
+In spring 1988 the editors of the papers of George Washington, John
+Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin were
+approached by classics scholar David Packard on behalf of the Packard
+Humanities Foundation with a proposal to produce a CD-ROM edition of the
+complete papers of each of the Founding Fathers.  This electronic edition
+will supplement the published volumes, making the documents widely
+available to students and researchers at reasonable cost.  We estimate
+that our CD-ROM edition of Washington's Papers will be substantially
+completed within the next two years and ready for publication.  Within
+the next ten years or so, similar CD-ROM editions of the Franklin, Adams,
+Jefferson, and Madison papers also will be available.  At the Library of
+Congress's session on technology, I would like to discuss not only the
+experience of the Washington Papers in producing the CD-ROM edition, but
+the impact technology has had on these major editorial projects. 
+Already, we are editing our volumes with an eye to the material that will
+be readily available in the CD-ROM edition.  The completed electronic
+edition will provide immense possibilities for the searching of documents
+for information in a way never possible before.  The kind of technical
+innovations that are currently available and on the drawing board will
+soon revolutionize historical research and the production of historical
+documents.  Unfortunately, much of this new technology is not being used
+in the planning stages of historical projects, simply because many
+historians are aware only in the vaguest way of its existence.  At least
+two major new historical editing projects are considering microfilm
+editions, simply because they are not aware of the possibilities of
+electronic alternatives and the advantages of the new technology in terms
+of flexibility and research potential compared to microfilm.  In fact,
+too many of us in history and literature are still at the stage of
+struggling with our PCs.  There are many historical editorial projects in
+progress presently, and an equal number of literary projects.  While the
+two fields have somewhat different approaches to textual editing, there
+are ways in which electronic technology can be of service to both.
+
+Since few of the editors involved in the Founding Fathers CD-ROM editions
+are technical experts in any sense, I hope to point out in my discussion
+of our experience how many of these electronic innovations can be used
+successfully by scholars who are novices in the world of new technology. 
+One of the major concerns of the sponsors of the multitude of new
+scholarly editions is the limited audience reached by the published
+volumes.  Most of these editions are being published in small quantities
+and the publishers' price for them puts them out of the reach not only of
+individual scholars but of most public libraries and all but the largest
+educational institutions.  However, little attention is being given to
+ways in which technology can bypass conventional publication to make
+historical and literary documents more widely available.
+
+What attracted us most to the CD-ROM edition of The Papers of George
+Washington was the fact that David Packard's aim was to make a complete
+edition of all of the 135,000 documents we have collected available in an
+inexpensive format that would be placed in public libraries, small
+colleges, and even high schools.  This would provide an audience far
+beyond our present 1,000-copy, $45 published edition.  Since the CD-ROM
+edition will carry none of the explanatory annotation that appears in the
+published volumes, we also feel that the use of the CD-ROM will lead many
+researchers to seek out the published volumes.
+
+In addition to ignorance of new technical advances, I have found that too
+many editors--and historians and literary scholars--are resistant and
+even hostile to suggestions that electronic technology may enhance their
+work.  I intend to discuss some of the arguments traditionalists are
+advancing to resist technology, ranging from distrust of the speed with
+which it changes (we are already wondering what is out there that is
+better than CD-ROM) to suspicion of the technical language used to
+describe electronic developments.

+
+Cornell University Library, Cornell Information Technologies, and Xerox
+Corporation, with the support of the Commission on Preservation and
+Access, and Sun Microsystems, Inc., have been collaborating in a project
+to test a prototype system for recording brittle books as digital images
+and producing, on demand, high-quality archival paper replacements.  The
+project goes beyond that, however, to investigate some of the issues
+surrounding scanning, storing, retrieving, and providing access to
+digital images in a network environment.
+
+The Joint Study in Digital Preservation began in January 1990.  Xerox
+provided the College Library Access and Storage System (CLASS) software,
+a prototype 600-dots-per-inch (dpi) scanner, and the hardware necessary
+to support network printing on the DocuTech printer housed in Cornell's
+Computing and Communications Center (CCC).
+
+The Cornell staff using the hardware and software became an integral part
+of the development and testing process for enhancements to the CLASS
+software system.  The collaborative nature of this relationship is
+resulting in a system that is specifically tailored to the preservation
+application.
+
+A digital library of 1,000 volumes (or approximately 300,000 images) has
+been created and is stored on an optical jukebox that resides in CCC. 
+The library includes a collection of select mathematics monographs that
+provides mathematics faculty with an opportunity to use the electronic
+library.  The remaining volumes were chosen for the library to test the
+various capabilities of the scanning system.
+
+One project objective is to provide users of the Cornell library and the
+library staff with the ability to request facsimiles of digitized images
+or to retrieve the actual electronic image for browsing.  A prototype
+viewing workstation has been created by Xerox, with input into the design
+by a committee of Cornell librarians and computer professionals.  This
+will allow us to experiment with patron access to the images that make up
+the digital library.  The viewing station provides search, retrieval, and
+(ultimately) printing functions with enhancements to facilitate
+navigation through multiple documents.
+
+Cornell currently is working to extend access to the digital library to
+readers using workstations from their offices.  This year is devoted to
+the development of a network resident image conversion and delivery
+server, and client software that will support readers who use Apple
+Macintosh computers, IBM windows platforms, and Sun workstations. 
+Equipment for this development was provided by Sun Microsystems with
+support from the Commission on Preservation and Access.
+
+During the show-and-tell session of the Workshop on Electronic Texts, a
+prototype view station will be demonstrated.  In addition, a display of
+original library books that have been digitized will be available for
+review with associated printed copies for comparison.  The fifteen-minute
+overview of the project will include a slide presentation that
+constitutes a "tour" of the preservation digitizing process.
+
+The final network-connected version of the viewing station will provide
+library users with another mechanism for accessing the digital library,
+and will also provide the capability of viewing images directly.  This
+will not require special software, although a powerful computer with good
+graphics will be needed.
+
+The Joint Study in Digital Preservation has generated a great deal of
+interest in the library community.  Unfortunately, or perhaps
+fortunately, this project serves to raise a vast number of other issues
+surrounding the use of digital technology for the preservation and use of
+deteriorating library materials, which subsequent projects will need to
+examine.  Much work remains.
+
+SESSION III
+
+Howard BESSER                      Networking Multimedia Databases
+
+What do we have to consider in building and distributing databases of
+visual materials in a multi-user environment?  This presentation examines
+a variety of concerns that need to be addressed before a multimedia
+database can be set up in a networked environment.
+
+In the past it has not been feasible to implement databases of visual
+materials in shared-user environments because of technological barriers. 
+Each of the two basic models for multi-user multimedia databases has
+posed its own problem.  The analog multimedia storage model (represented
+by Project Athena's parallel analog and digital networks) has required an
+incredibly complex (and expensive) infrastructure.  The economies of
+scale that make multi-user setups cheaper per user served do not operate
+in an environment that requires a computer workstation, videodisc player,
+and two display devices for each user.
+
+The digital multimedia storage model has required vast amounts of storage
+space (as much as one gigabyte per thirty still images).  In the past the
+cost of such a large amount of storage space made this model a
+prohibitive choice as well.  But plunging storage costs are finally
+making this second alternative viable.
+
+If storage no longer poses such an impediment, what do we need to
+consider in building digitally stored multi-user databases of visual
+materials?  This presentation will examine the networking and
+telecommunication constraints that must be overcome before such databases
+can become commonplace and useful to a large number of people.
+
+The key problem is the vast size of multimedia documents, and how this
+affects not only storage but telecommunications transmission time. 
+Anything slower than T-1 speed is impractical for files of 1 megabyte or
+larger (which is likely to be small for a multimedia document).  For
+instance, even on a 56 Kb line it would take three minutes to transfer a
+1-megabyte file.  And these figures assume ideal circumstances, and do
+not take into consideration other users contending for network bandwidth,
+disk access time, or the time needed for remote display.  Current common
+telephone transmission rates would be completely impractical; few users
+would be willing to wait the hour necessary to transmit a single image at
+2400 baud.
+
+This necessitates compression, which itself raises a number of other
+issues.  In order to decrease file sizes significantly, we must employ
+lossy compression algorithms.  But how much quality can we afford to
+lose?  To date there has been only one significant study done of
+image-quality needs for a particular user group, and this study did not
+look at loss resulting from compression.  Only after identifying
+image-quality needs can we begin to address storage and network bandwidth
+needs.
+
+Experience with X-Windows-based applications (such as Imagequery, the
+University of California at Berkeley image database) demonstrates the
+utility of a client-server topology, but also points to the limitation of
+current software for a distributed environment.  For example,
+applications like Imagequery can incorporate compression, but current X
+implementations do not permit decompression at the end user's
+workstation.  Such decompression at the host computer alleviates storage
+capacity problems while doing nothing to address problems of
+telecommunications bandwidth.
+
+We need to examine the effects on network through-put of moving
+multimedia documents around on a network.  We need to examine various
+topologies that will help us avoid bottlenecks around servers and
+gateways.  Experience with applications such as these raise still broader
+questions. How closely is the multimedia document tied to the software
+for viewing it?  Can it be accessed and viewed from other applications? 
+Experience with the MARC format (and more recently with the Z39.50
+protocols) shows how useful it can be to store documents in a form in
+which they can be accessed by a variety of application software.
+
+Finally, from an intellectual-access standpoint, we need to address the
+issue of providing access to these multimedia documents in
+interdisciplinary environments.  We need to examine terminology and
+indexing strategies that will allow us to provide access to this material
+in a cross-disciplinary way.
+
+Ronald LARSEN            Directions in High-Performance Networking for
+                         Libraries
+
+The pace at which computing technology has advanced over the past forty
+years shows no sign of abating.  Roughly speaking, each five-year period
+has yielded an order-of-magnitude improvement in price and performance of
+computing equipment.  No fundamental hurdles are likely to prevent this
+pace from continuing for at least the next decade.  It is only in the
+past five years, though, that computing has become ubiquitous in
+libraries, affecting all staff and patrons, directly or indirectly.
+
+During these same five years, communications rates on the Internet, the
+principal academic computing network, have grown from 56 kbps to 1.5
+Mbps, and the NSFNet backbone is now running 45 Mbps.  Over the next five
+years, communication rates on the backbone are expected to exceed 1 Gbps. 
+Growth in both the population of network users and the volume of network
+traffic  has continued to grow geometrically, at rates approaching 15
+percent per month.  This flood of capacity and use, likened by some to
+"drinking from a firehose,"  creates immense opportunities and challenges
+for libraries.  Libraries must anticipate the future implications of this
+technology, participate in its development, and deploy it to ensure
+access to the world's information resources.
+
+The infrastructure for the information age is being put in place. 
+Libraries face strategic decisions about their role in the development,
+deployment, and use of this infrastructure.  The emerging infrastructure
+is much more than computers and communication lines.  It is more than the
+ability to compute at a remote site, send electronic mail to a peer
+across the country, or move a file from one library to another.  The next
+five years will witness substantial development of the information
+infrastructure of the network.
+
+In order to provide appropriate leadership, library professionals must
+have a fundamental understanding of and appreciation for computer
+networking, from local area networks to the National Research and
+Education Network (NREN).  This presentation addresses these
+fundamentals, and how they relate to libraries today and in the near
+future.
+
+Edwin BROWNRIGG               Electronic Library Visions and Realities
+
+The electronic library has been a vision desired by many--and rejected by
+some--since Vannevar Bush coined the term memex to describe an automated,
+intelligent, personal information system.  Variations on this vision have
+included Ted Nelson's Xanadau, Alan Kay's Dynabook, and Lancaster's
+"paperless library," with the most recent incarnation being the
+"Knowledge Navigator" described by John Scully of Apple.  But the reality
+of library service has been less visionary and the leap to the electronic
+library has eluded universities, publishers, and information technology
+files.
+
+The Memex Research Institute (MemRI), an independent, nonprofit research
+and development organization, has created an Electronic Library Program
+of shared research and development in order to make the collective vision
+more concrete.  The program is working toward the creation of large,
+indexed publicly available electronic image collections of published
+documents in academic, special, and public libraries.  This strategic
+plan is the result of the first stage of the program, which has been an
+investigation of the information technologies available to support such
+an effort, the economic parameters of electronic service compared to
+traditional library operations, and the business and political factors
+affecting the shift from print distribution to electronic networked
+access.
+
+The strategic plan envisions a combination of publicly searchable access
+databases, image (and text) document collections stored on network "file
+servers," local and remote network access, and an intellectual property
+management-control system.  This combination of technology and
+information content is defined in this plan as an E-library or E-library
+collection.  Some participating sponsors are already developing projects
+based on MemRI's recommended directions.
+
+The E-library strategy projected in this plan is a visionary one that can
+enable major changes and improvements in academic, public, and special
+library service.  This vision is, though, one that can be realized with
+today's technology.  At the same time, it will challenge the political
+and social structure within which libraries operate:  in academic
+libraries, the traditional emphasis on local collections, extending to
+accreditation issues; in public libraries, the potential of electronic
+branch and central libraries fully available to the public; and for
+special libraries, new opportunities for shared collections and networks.
+
+The environment in which this strategic plan has been developed is, at
+the moment, dominated by a sense of library limits.  The continued
+expansion and rapid growth of local academic library collections is now
+clearly at an end.  Corporate libraries, and even law libraries, are
+faced with operating within a difficult economic climate, as well as with
+very active competition from commercial information sources.  For
+example, public libraries may be seen as a desirable but not critical
+municipal service in a time when the budgets of safety and health
+agencies are being cut back.
+
+Further, libraries in general have a very high labor-to-cost ratio in
+their budgets, and labor costs are still increasing, notwithstanding
+automation investments.  It is difficult for libraries to obtain capital,
+startup, or seed funding for innovative activities, and those
+technology-intensive initiatives that offer the potential of decreased
+labor costs can provoke the opposition of library staff.
+
+However, libraries have achieved some considerable successes in the past
+two decades by improving both their service and their credibility within
+their organizations--and these positive changes have been accomplished
+mostly with judicious use of information technologies.  The advances in
+computing and information technology have been well-chronicled:  the
+continuing precipitous drop in computing costs, the growth of the
+Internet and private networks, and the explosive increase in publicly
+available information databases.
+
+For example, OCLC has become one of the largest computer network
+organizations in the world by creating a cooperative cataloging network
+of more than 6,000 libraries worldwide.  On-line public access catalogs
+now serve millions of users on more than 50,000 dedicated terminals in
+the United States alone.  The University of California MELVYL on-line
+catalog system has now expanded into an index database reference service
+and supports more than six million searches a year.  And, libraries have
+become the largest group of customers of CD-ROM publishing technology;
+more than 30,000 optical media publications such as those offered by
+InfoTrac and Silver Platter are subscribed to by U.S. libraries.
+
+This march of technology continues and in the next decade will result in
+further innovations that are extremely difficult to predict.  What is
+clear is that libraries can now go beyond automation of their order files
+and catalogs to automation of their collections themselves--and it is
+possible to circumvent the fiscal limitations that appear to obtain
+today.
+

+
+The Cornell/Xerox Joint Study in Digital Preservation resulted in the
+recording of 1,000 brittle books as 600-dpi digital images and the
+production, on demand, of high-quality and archivally sound paper
+replacements.  The project, which was supported by the Commission on
+Preservation and Access, also investigated some of the issues surrounding
+scanning, storing, retrieving, and providing access to digital images in
+a network environment.
+
+Anne Kenney will focus on some of the issues surrounding direct scanning
+as identified in the Cornell Xerox Project.  Among those to be discussed
+are:  image versus text capture; indexing and access; image-capture
+capabilities; a comparison to photocopy and microfilm; production and
+cost analysis; storage formats, protocols, and standards; and the use of
+this scanning technology for preservation purposes.
+
+The 600-dpi digital images produced in the Cornell Xerox Project proved
+highly acceptable for creating paper replacements of deteriorating
+originals.  The 1,000 scanned volumes provided an array of image-capture
+challenges that are common to nineteenth-century printing techniques and
+embrittled material, and that defy the use of text-conversion processes. 
+These challenges include diminished contrast between text and background,
+fragile and deteriorated pages, uneven printing, elaborate type faces,
+faint and bold text adjacency, handwritten text and annotations, nonRoman
+languages, and a proliferation of illustrated material embedded in text. 
+The latter category included high-frequency and low-frequency halftones,
+continuous tone photographs, intricate mathematical drawings, maps,
+etchings, reverse-polarity drawings, and engravings.
+
+The Xerox prototype scanning system provided a number of important
+features for capturing this diverse material.  Technicians used multiple
+threshold settings, filters, line art and halftone definitions,
+autosegmentation, windowing, and software-editing programs to optimize
+image capture.  At the same time, this project focused on production. 
+The goal was to make scanning as affordable and acceptable as
+photocopying and microfilming for preservation reformatting.  A
+time-and-cost study conducted during the last three months of this
+project confirmed the economic viability of digital scanning, and these
+findings will be discussed here.
+
+From the outset, the Cornell Xerox Project was predicated on the use of
+nonproprietary standards and the use of common protocols when standards
+did not exist.  Digital files were created as TIFF images which were
+compressed prior to storage using Group 4 CCITT compression.  The Xerox
+software is MS DOS based and utilizes off-the shelf programs such as
+Microsoft Windows and Wang Image Wizard.  The digital library is designed
+to be hardware-independent and to provide interchangeability with other
+institutions through network connections.  Access to the digital files
+themselves is two-tiered:  Bibliographic records for the computer files
+are created in RLIN and Cornell's local system and access into the actual
+digital images comprising a book is provided through a document control
+structure and a networked image file-server, both of which will be
+described.
+
+The presentation will conclude with a discussion of some of the issues
+surrounding the use of this technology as a preservation tool (storage,
+refreshing, backup).

+
+The National Agricultural Library (NAL) has had extensive experience with
+raster scanning of printed materials.  Since 1987, the Library has
+participated in the National Agricultural Text Digitizing Project (NATDP)
+a cooperative effort between NAL and forty-five land grant university
+libraries.  An overview of the project will be presented, giving its
+history and NAL's strategy for the future.
+
+An in-depth discussion of NATDP will follow, including a description of
+the scanning process, from the gathering of the printed materials to the
+archiving of the electronic pages.  The type of equipment required for a
+stand-alone scanning workstation and the importance of file management
+software will be discussed.  Issues concerning the images themselves will
+be addressed briefly, such as image format; black and white versus color;
+gray scale versus dithering; and resolution.
+
+Also described will be a study currently in progress by NAL to evaluate
+the usefulness of converting microfilm to electronic images in order to
+improve access.  With the cooperation of Tuskegee University, NAL has
+selected three reels of microfilm from a collection of sixty-seven reels
+containing the papers, letters, and drawings of George Washington Carver. 
+The three reels were converted into 3,500 electronic images using a
+specialized microfilm scanner.  The selection, filming, and indexing of
+this material will be discussed.

+
+Project Open Book, the Yale University Library's effort to convert 10,
+000 books from microfilm to digital imagery, is currently in an advanced
+state of planning and organization.  The Yale Library has selected a
+major vendor to serve as a partner in the project and as systems
+integrator.  In its proposal, the successful vendor helped isolate areas
+of risk and uncertainty as well as key issues to be addressed during the
+life of the project.  The Yale Library is now poised to decide what
+material it will convert to digital image form and to seek funding,
+initially for the first phase and then for the entire project.
+
+The proposal that Yale accepted for the implementation of Project Open
+Book will provide at the end of three phases a conversion subsystem,
+browsing stations distributed on the campus network within the Yale
+Library, a subsystem for storing 10,000 books at 200 and 600 dots per
+inch, and network access to the image printers.  Pricing for the system
+implementation assumes the existence of Yale's campus ethernet network
+and its high-speed image printers, and includes other requisite hardware
+and software, as well as system integration services.  Proposed operating
+costs include hardware and software maintenance, but do not include
+estimates for the facilities management of the storage devices and image
+servers.
+
+Yale selected its vendor partner in a formal process, partly funded by
+the Commission for Preservation and Access.  Following a request for
+proposal, the Yale Library selected two vendors as finalists to work with
+Yale staff to generate a detailed analysis of requirements for Project
+Open Book.  Each vendor used the results of the requirements analysis to
+generate and submit a formal proposal for the entire project.  This
+competitive process not only enabled the Yale Library to select its
+primary vendor partner but also revealed much about the state of the
+imaging industry, about the varying, corporate commitments to the markets
+for imaging technology, and about the varying organizational dynamics
+through which major companies are responding to and seeking to develop
+these markets.
+
+Project Open Book is focused specifically on the conversion of images
+from microfilm to digital form.  The technology for scanning microfilm is
+readily available but is changing rapidly.  In its project requirements,
+the Yale Library emphasized features of the technology that affect the
+technical quality of digital image production and the costs of creating
+and storing the image library:  What levels of digital resolution can be
+achieved by scanning microfilm?  How does variation in the quality of
+microfilm, particularly in film produced to preservation standards,
+affect the quality of the digital images?  What technologies can an
+operator effectively and economically apply when scanning film to
+separate two-up images and to control for and correct image
+imperfections?  How can quality control best be integrated into
+digitizing work flow that includes document indexing and storage?
+
+The actual and expected uses of digital images--storage, browsing,
+printing, and OCR--help determine the standards for measuring their
+quality.  Browsing is especially important, but the facilities available
+for readers to browse image documents is perhaps the weakest aspect of
+imaging technology and most in need of development.  As it defined its
+requirements, the Yale Library concentrated on some fundamental aspects
+of usability for image documents:  Does the system have sufficient
+flexibility to handle the full range of document types, including
+monographs, multi-part and multivolume sets, and serials, as well as
+manuscript collections?  What conventions are necessary to identify a
+document uniquely for storage and retrieval?  Where is the database of
+record for storing bibliographic information about the image document? 
+How are basic internal structures of documents, such as pagination, made
+accessible to the reader?  How are the image documents physically
+presented on the screen to the reader?
+
+The Yale Library designed Project Open Book on the assumption that
+microfilm is more than adequate as a medium for preserving the content of
+deteriorated library materials.  As planning in the project has advanced,
+it is increasingly clear that the challenge of digital image technology
+and the key to the success of efforts like Project Open Book is to
+provide a means of both preserving and improving access to those
+deteriorated materials.
+
+SESSION IV-B
+
+George THOMA
+
+In the use of electronic imaging for document preservation, there are
+several issues to consider, such as:  ensuring adequate image quality,
+maintaining substantial conversion rates (through-put), providing unique
+identification for automated access and retrieval, and accommodating
+bound volumes and fragile material.
+
+To maintain high image quality, image processing functions are required
+to correct the deficiencies in the scanned image.  Some commercially
+available systems include these functions, while some do not.  The
+scanned raw image must be processed to correct contrast deficiencies--
+both poor overall contrast resulting from light print and/or dark
+background, and variable contrast resulting from stains and
+bleed-through.  Furthermore, the scan density must be adequate to allow
+legibility of print and sufficient fidelity in the pseudo-halftoned gray
+material.  Borders or page-edge effects must be removed for both
+compactibility and aesthetics.  Page skew must be corrected for aesthetic
+reasons and to enable accurate character recognition if desired. 
+Compound images consisting of both two-toned text and gray-scale
+illustrations must be processed appropriately to retain the quality of
+each.

+
+Standards publications being developed by scientists, engineers, and
+business managers in Association for Information and Image Management
+(AIIM) standards committees can be applied to electronic image management
+(EIM) processes including:  document (image) transfer, retrieval and
+evaluation; optical disk and document scanning; and document design and
+conversion.  When combined with EIM system planning and operations,
+standards can assist in generating image databases that are
+interchangeable among a variety of systems.  The applications of
+different approaches for image-tagging, indexing, compression, and
+transfer often cause uncertainty concerning EIM system compatibility,
+calibration, performance, and upward compatibility, until standard
+implementation parameters are established.  The AIIM standards that are
+being developed for these applications can be used to decrease the
+uncertainty, successfully integrate imaging processes, and promote "open
+systems."  AIIM is an accredited American National Standards Institute
+(ANSI) standards developer with more than twenty committees comprised of
+300 volunteers representing users, vendors, and manufacturers.  The
+standards publications that are developed in these committees have
+national acceptance and provide the basis for international harmonization
+in the development of new International Organization for Standardization
+(ISO) standards.
+
+This presentation describes the development of AIIM's EIM standards and a
+new effort at AIIM, a database on standards projects in a wide framework
+of imaging industries including capture, recording, processing,
+duplication, distribution, display, evaluation, and preservation.  The
+AIIM Imagery Database will cover imaging standards being developed by
+many organizations in many different countries.  It will contain
+standards publications' dates, origins, related national and
+international projects, status, key words, and abstracts.  The ANSI Image
+Technology Standards Board requested that such a database be established,
+as did the ISO/International Electrotechnical Commission Joint Task Force
+on Imagery.  AIIM will take on the leadership role for the database and
+coordinate its development with several standards developers.

+
+     Characteristics of standards for digital imagery:
+
+          * Nature of digital technology implies continuing volatility.
+
+          * Precipitous standard-setting not possible and probably not
+          desirable.
+
+          * Standards are a complex issue involving the medium, the
+          hardware, the software, and the technical capacity for
+          reproductive fidelity and clarity.
+
+          * The prognosis for reliable archival standards (as defined by
+          librarians) in the foreseeable future is poor.
+
+     Significant potential and attractiveness of digital technology as a
+     preservation medium and access mechanism.
+
+     Productive use of digital imagery for preservation requires a
+     reconceptualizing of preservation principles in a volatile,
+     standardless world.
+
+     Concept of managing continuing access in the digital environment
+     rather than focusing on the permanence of the medium and long-term
+     archival standards developed for the analog world.
+
+     Transition period:  How long and what to do?
+
+          *  Redefine "archival."
+
+          *  Remove the burden of "archival copy" from paper artifacts.
+
+          *  Use digital technology for storage, develop management
+          strategies for refreshing medium, hardware and software.
+
+          *  Create acid-free paper copies for transition period backup
+          until we develop reliable procedures for ensuring continuing
+          access to digital files.

+Stuart WEIBEL            The Role of SGML Markup in the CORE Project (6)
+
+The emergence of high-speed telecommunications networks as a basic
+feature of the scholarly workplace is driving the demand for electronic
+document delivery.  Three distinct categories of electronic
+publishing/republishing are necessary to support access demands in this
+emerging environment:
+
+     1.)  Conversion of paper or microfilm archives to electronic format
+     2.)  Conversion of electronic files to formats tailored to
+          electronic retrieval and display
+     3.)  Primary electronic publishing (materials for which the
+          electronic version is the primary format)
+
+OCLC has experimental or product development activities in each of these
+areas.  Among the challenges that lie ahead is the integration of these
+three types of information stores in coherent distributed systems.
+
+The CORE (Chemistry Online Retrieval Experiment) Project is a model for
+the conversion of large text and graphics collections for which
+electronic typesetting files are available (category 2).  The American
+Chemical Society has made available computer typography files dating from
+1980 for its twenty journals.  This collection of some 250 journal-years
+is being converted to an electronic format that will be accessible
+through several end-user applications.
+
+The use of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) offers the means
+to capture the structural richness of the original articles in a way that
+will support a variety of retrieval, navigation, and display options
+necessary to navigate effectively in very large text databases.
+
+An SGML document consists of text that is marked up with descriptive tags
+that specify the function of a given element within the document.  As a
+formal language construct, an SGML document can be parsed against a
+document-type definition (DTD) that unambiguously defines what elements
+are allowed and where in the document they can (or must) occur.  This
+formalized map of article structure allows the user interface design to
+be uncoupled from the underlying database system, an important step
+toward interoperability.  Demonstration of this separability is a part of
+the CORE project, wherein user interface designs born of very different
+philosophies will access the same database.
+
+NOTES:
+     (6)  The CORE project is a collaboration among Cornell University's

+
+A major on-line file of chemical journal literature complete with
+graphics is being developed to test the usability of fully electronic
+access to documents, as a joint project of Cornell University, the
+American Chemical Society, the Chemical Abstracts Service, OCLC, and
+Bellcore (with additional support from Sun Microsystems, Springer-Verlag,
+DigitaI Equipment Corporation, Sony Corporation of America, and Apple
+Computers).  Our file contains the American Chemical Society's on-line
+journals, supplemented with the graphics from the paper publication.  The
+indexing of the articles from Chemical Abstracts Documents is available
+in both image and text format, and several different interfaces can be
+used.  Our goals are (1) to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of
+electronic access to primary journals as compared with paper, and (2) to
+identify the most desirable functions of the user interface to an
+electronic system of journals, including in particular a comparison of
+page-image display with ASCII display interfaces.  Early experiments with
+chemistry students on a variety of tasks suggest that searching tasks are
+completed much faster with any electronic system than with paper, but
+that for reading all versions of the articles are roughly equivalent.

+Pamela ANDRE and Judith ZIDAR
+
+Text conversion is far more expensive and time-consuming than image
+capture alone.  NAL's experience with optical character recognition (OCR)
+will be related and compared with the experience of having text rekeyed. 
+What factors affect OCR accuracy?  How accurate does full text have to be
+in order to be useful?  How do different users react to imperfect text? 
+These are questions that will be explored.  For many, a service bureau
+may be a better solution than performing the work inhouse; this will also
+be discussed.

+Copyright law protects creative works.  Protection granted by the law to
+authors and disseminators of works includes the right to do or authorize
+the following:  reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute
+the work to the public, and publicly perform or display the work.  In
+addition, copyright owners of sound recordings and computer programs have
+the right to control rental of their works.  These rights are not
+unlimited; there are a number of exceptions and limitations.
+
+An electronic environment places strains on the copyright system. 
+Copyright owners want to control uses of their work and be paid for any
+use; the public wants quick and easy access at little or no cost.  The
+marketplace is working in this area.  Contracts, guidelines on electronic
+use, and collective licensing are in use and being refined.
+
+Issues concerning the ability to change works without detection are more
+difficult to deal with.  Questions concerning the integrity of the work

+
+This is the February 1992 Project Gutenberg release of: 
+ 
+Paradise Lost by John Milton 
+ 
+The oldest etext known to Project Gutenberg (ca. 1964-1965) 
+(If you know of any older ones, please let us know.) 
+ 
+ 
+Introduction  (one page) 
+ 
+This etext was originally created in 1964-1965 according to Dr. 
+Joseph Raben of Queens College, NY, to whom it is attributed by 
+Project Gutenberg.  We had heard of this etext for years but it 
+was not until 1991 that we actually managed to track it down to 
+a specific location, and then it took months to convince people 
+to let us have a copy, then more months for them actually to do 
+the copying and get it to us.  Then another month to convert to 
+something we could massage with our favorite 486 in DOS.  After 
+that is was only a matter of days to get it into this shape you 
+will see below.  The original was, of course, in CAPS only, and 
+so were all the other etexts of the 60's and early 70's.  Don't 
+let anyone fool you into thinking any etext with both upper and 
+lower case is an original; all those original Project Gutenberg 
+etexts were also in upper case and were translated or rewritten 
+many times to get them into their current condition.  They have 
+been worked on by many people throughout the world. 
+ 
+In the course of our searches for Professor Raben and his etext 
+we were never able to determine where copies were or which of a 
+variety of editions he may have used as a source.  We did get a 
+little information here and there, but even after we received a 
+copy of the etext we were unwilling to release it without first 
+determining that it was in fact Public Domain and finding Raben 
+to verify this and get his permission.  Interested enough, in a 
+totally unrelated action to our searches for him, the professor 
+subscribed to the Project Gutenberg listserver and we happened, 
+by accident, to notice his name. (We don't really look at every 
+subscription request as the computers usually handle them.) The 
+etext was then properly identified, copyright analyzed, and the 
+current edition prepared. 
+ 
+To give you an estimation of the difference in the original and 
+what we have today:  the original was probably entered on cards 
+commonly known at the time as "IBM cards" (Do Not Fold, Spindle 
+or Mutilate) and probably took in excess of 100,000 of them.  A 
+single card could hold 80 characters (hence 80 characters is an 
+accepted standard for so many computer margins), and the entire 
+original edition we received in all caps was over 800,000 chars 
+in length, including line enumeration, symbols for caps and the 
+punctuation marks, etc., since they were not available keyboard 
+characters at the time (probably the keyboards operated at baud 
+rates of around 113, meaning the typists had to type slowly for 
+the keyboard to keep up). 
+ 
+This is the second version of Paradise Lost released by Project 
+Gutenberg.  The first was released as our October, 1991 etext. 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+Paradise Lost 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+Book I 
+ 
+ 
+Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit 
+Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste 
+Brought death into the World, and all our woe, 
+With loss of Eden, till one greater Man 
+Restore us, and regain the blissful seat, 
+Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top 
+Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire 
+That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed 
+In the beginning how the heavens and earth 
+Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill 
+Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed 
+Fast by the oracle of God, I thence 
+Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song, 
+That with no middle flight intends to soar 
+Above th' Aonian mount, while it pursues 
+Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme. 
+And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer 
+Before all temples th' upright heart and pure, 
+Instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first 
+Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread, 
+Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss, 
+And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark 
+Illumine, what is low raise and support; 
+That, to the height of this great argument, 
+I may assert Eternal Providence, 
+And justify the ways of God to men. 
+  Say first--for Heaven hides nothing from thy view, 
+Nor the deep tract of Hell--say first what cause 
+Moved our grand parents, in that happy state, 
+Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off 
+From their Creator, and transgress his will 
+For one restraint, lords of the World besides. 
+Who first seduced them to that foul revolt? 
+  Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile, 
+Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived 
+The mother of mankind, what time his pride 
+Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host 
+Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring 
+To set himself in glory above his peers, 
+He trusted to have equalled the Most High, 
+If he opposed, and with ambitious aim 
+Against the throne and monarchy of God, 
+Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud, 
+With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power 
+Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky, 
+With hideous ruin and combustion, down 
+To bottomless perdition, there to dwell 
+In adamantine chains and penal fire, 
+Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms. 
+  Nine times the space that measures day and night 
+To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew, 
+Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf, 
+Confounded, though immortal. But his doom 
+Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought 
+Both of lost happiness and lasting pain 
+Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes, 
+That witnessed huge affliction and dismay, 
+Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate. 
+At once, as far as Angels ken, he views 
+The dismal situation waste and wild. 
+A dungeon horrible, on all sides round, 
+As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames 
+No light; but rather darkness visible 
+Served only to discover sights of woe, 
+Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace 
+And rest can never dwell, hope never comes 
+That comes to all, but torture without end 
+Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed 
+With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed. 
+Such place Eternal Justice has prepared 
+For those rebellious; here their prison ordained 
+In utter darkness, and their portion set, 
+As far removed from God and light of Heaven 
+As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole. 
+Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell! 
+There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed 
+With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, 
+He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side, 
+One next himself in power, and next in crime, 
+Long after known in Palestine, and named 
+Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy, 
+And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words 
+Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:-- 
+  "If thou beest he--but O how fallen! how changed 
+From him who, in the happy realms of light 
+Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine 
+Myriads, though bright!--if he whom mutual league, 
+United thoughts and counsels, equal hope 
+And hazard in the glorious enterprise 
+Joined with me once, now misery hath joined 
+In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest 
+From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved 
+He with his thunder; and till then who knew 
+The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those, 
+Nor what the potent Victor in his rage 
+Can else inflict, do I repent, or change, 
+Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind, 
+And high disdain from sense of injured merit, 
+That with the Mightiest raised me to contend, 
+And to the fierce contentions brought along 
+Innumerable force of Spirits armed, 
+That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring, 
+His utmost power with adverse power opposed 
+In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven, 
+And shook his throne. What though the field be lost? 
+All is not lost--the unconquerable will, 
+And study of revenge, immortal hate, 
+And courage never to submit or yield: 
+And what is else not to be overcome? 
+That glory never shall his wrath or might 
+Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace 
+With suppliant knee, and deify his power 
+Who, from the terror of this arm, so late 
+Doubted his empire--that were low indeed; 
+That were an ignominy and shame beneath 
+This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods, 
+And this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail; 
+Since, through experience of this great event, 
+In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced, 
+We may with more successful hope resolve 
+To wage by force or guile eternal war, 
+Irreconcilable to our grand Foe, 
+Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy 
+Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven." 
+  So spake th' apostate Angel, though in pain, 
+Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair; 
+And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:-- 
+  "O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers 
+That led th' embattled Seraphim to war 
+Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds 
+Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King, 
+And put to proof his high supremacy, 
+Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate, 
+Too well I see and rue the dire event 
+That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat, 
+Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host 
+In horrible destruction laid thus low, 
+As far as Gods and heavenly Essences 
+Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains 
+Invincible, and vigour soon returns, 
+Though all our glory extinct, and happy state 
+Here swallowed up in endless misery. 
+But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now 
+Of force believe almighty, since no less 
+Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours) 
+Have left us this our spirit and strength entire, 
+Strongly to suffer and support our pains, 
+That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, 
+Or do him mightier service as his thralls 
+By right of war, whate'er his business be, 
+Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire, 
+Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep? 
+What can it the avail though yet we feel 
+Strength undiminished, or eternal being 
+To undergo eternal punishment?" 
+  Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied:-- 
+"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable, 
+Doing or suffering: but of this be sure-- 
+To do aught good never will be our task, 
+But ever to do ill our sole delight, 
+As being the contrary to his high will 
+Whom we resist. If then his providence 
+Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, 
+Our labour must be to pervert that end, 
+And out of good still to find means of evil; 
+Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps 
+Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb 
+His inmost counsels from their destined aim. 
+But see! the angry Victor hath recalled 
+His ministers of vengeance and pursuit 
+Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail, 
+Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid 
+The fiery surge that from the precipice 
+Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder, 
+Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage, 
+Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now 
+To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. 
+Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn 
+Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. 
+Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild, 
+The seat of desolation, void of light, 
+Save what the glimmering of these livid flames 
+Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend 
+From off the tossing of these fiery waves; 
+There rest, if any rest can harbour there; 
+And, re-assembling our afflicted powers, 
+Consult how we may henceforth most offend 
+Our enemy, our own loss how repair, 
+How overcome this dire calamity, 
+What reinforcement we may gain from hope, 
+If not, what resolution from despair." 
+  Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate, 
+With head uplift above the wave, and eyes 
+That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides 
+Prone on the flood, extended long and large, 
+Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge 
+As whom the fables name of monstrous size, 
+Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove, 
+Briareos or Typhon, whom the den 
+By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast 
+Leviathan, which God of all his works 
+Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream. 
+Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam, 
+The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff, 
+Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell, 
+With fixed anchor in his scaly rind, 
+Moors by his side under the lee, while night 
+Invests the sea, and wished morn delays. 
+So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay, 
+Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence 
+Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will 
+And high permission of all-ruling Heaven 
+Left him at large to his own dark designs, 
+That with reiterated crimes he might 
+Heap on himself damnation, while he sought 
+Evil to others, and enraged might see 
+How all his malice served but to bring forth 
+Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn 
+On Man by him seduced, but on himself 
+Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured. 
+  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool 
+His mighty stature; on each hand the flames 
+Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and,rolled 
+In billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale. 
+Then with expanded wings he steers his flight 
+Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air, 
+That felt unusual weight; till on dry land 
+He lights--if it were land that ever burned 
+With solid, as the lake with liquid fire, 
+And such appeared in hue as when the force 
+Of subterranean wind transprots a hill 
+Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side 
+Of thundering Etna, whose combustible 
+And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire, 
+Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds, 
+And leave a singed bottom all involved 
+With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole 
+Of unblest feet. Him followed his next mate; 
+Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood 
+As gods, and by their own recovered strength, 
+Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. 
+  "Is this the region, this the soil, the clime," 
+Said then the lost Archangel, "this the seat 
+That we must change for Heaven?--this mournful gloom 
+For that celestial light? Be it so, since he 
+Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid 
+What shall be right: farthest from him is best 
+Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme 
+Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields, 
+Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail, 
+Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell, 
+Receive thy new possessor--one who brings 
+A mind not to be changed by place or time. 
+The mind is its own place, and in itself 
+Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven. 
+What matter where, if I be still the same, 
+And what I should be, all but less than he 
+Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least 
+We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built 
+Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: 
+Here we may reigh secure; and, in my choice, 
+To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell: 
+Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven. 
+But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, 
+Th' associates and co-partners of our loss, 
+Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool, 
+And call them not to share with us their part 
+In this unhappy mansion, or once more 
+With rallied arms to try what may be yet 
+Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?" 
+  So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub 
+Thus answered:--"Leader of those armies bright 
+Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled! 
+If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge 
+Of hope in fears and dangers--heard so oft 
+In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge 
+Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults 
+Their surest signal--they will soon resume 
+New courage and revive, though now they lie 
+Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire, 
+As we erewhile, astounded and amazed; 
+No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!" 
+  He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend 
+Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield, 
+Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round, 
+Behind him cast. The broad circumference 
+Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb 
+Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views 
+At evening, from the top of Fesole, 
+Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands, 
+Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe. 
+His spear--to equal which the tallest pine 
+Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast 
+Of some great ammiral, were but a wand-- 
+He walked with, to support uneasy steps 
+Over the burning marl, not like those steps 
+On Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime 
+Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire. 
+Nathless he so endured, till on the beach 
+Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called 
+His legions--Angel Forms, who lay entranced 
+Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks 
+In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades 
+High over-arched embower; or scattered sedge 
+Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed 
+Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew 
+Busiris and his Memphian chivalry, 
+While with perfidious hatred they pursued 
+The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld 
+From the safe shore their floating carcases 
+And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown, 
+Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood, 
+Under amazement of their hideous change. 
+He called so loud that all the hollow deep 
+Of Hell resounded:--"Princes, Potentates, 
+Warriors, the Flower of Heaven--once yours; now lost, 
+If such astonishment as this can seize 
+Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place 
+After the toil of battle to repose 
+Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find 
+To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven? 
+Or in this abject posture have ye sworn 
+To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds 
+Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood 
+With scattered arms and ensigns, till anon 
+His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern 
+Th' advantage, and, descending, tread us down 
+Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts 
+Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf? 
+Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!" 
+  They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung 
+Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch 
+On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, 
+Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. 
+Nor did they not perceive the evil plight 
+In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; 
+Yet to their General's voice they soon obeyed 
+Innumerable. As when the potent rod 
+Of Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day, 
+Waved round the coast, up-called a pitchy cloud 
+Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind, 
+That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung 
+Like Night, and darkened all the land of Nile; 
+So numberless were those bad Angels seen 
+Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell, 
+'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires; 
+Till, as a signal given, th' uplifted spear 
+Of their great Sultan waving to direct 
+Their course, in even balance down they light 
+On the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain: 
+A multitude like which the populous North 
+Poured never from her frozen loins to pass 
+Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons 
+Came like a deluge on the South, and spread 
+Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands. 
+Forthwith, form every squadron and each band, 
+The heads and leaders thither haste where stood 
+Their great Commander--godlike Shapes, and Forms 
+Excelling human; princely Dignities; 
+And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones, 
+Though on their names in Heavenly records now 
+Be no memorial, blotted out and rased 
+By their rebellion from the Books of Life. 
+Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve 
+Got them new names, till, wandering o'er the earth, 
+Through God's high sufferance for the trial of man, 
+By falsities and lies the greatest part 
+Of mankind they corrupted to forsake 
+God their Creator, and th' invisible 
+Glory of him that made them to transform 
+Oft to the image of a brute, adorned 
+With gay religions full of pomp and gold, 
+And devils to adore for deities: 
+Then were they known to men by various names, 
+And various idols through the heathen world. 
+  Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last, 
+Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch, 
+At their great Emperor's call, as next in worth 
+Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, 
+While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof? 
+  The chief were those who, from the pit of Hell 
+Roaming to seek their prey on Earth, durst fix 
+Their seats, long after, next the seat of God, 
+Their altars by his altar, gods adored 
+Among the nations round, and durst abide 
+Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned 
+Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed 
+Within his sanctuary itself their shrines, 
+Abominations; and with cursed things 
+His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned, 
+And with their darkness durst affront his light. 
+First, Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood 
+Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears; 
+Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud, 
+Their children's cries unheard that passed through fire 
+To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite 
+Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain, 
+In Argob and in Basan, to the stream 
+Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such 
+Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart 
+Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build 
+His temple right against the temple of God 
+On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove 
+The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence 
+And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell. 
+Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moab's sons, 
+From Aroar to Nebo and the wild 
+Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon 
+And Horonaim, Seon's real, beyond 
+The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines, 
+And Eleale to th' Asphaltic Pool: 
+Peor his other name, when he enticed 
+Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile, 
+To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. 
+Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged 
+Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove 
+Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate, 
+Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell. 
+With these came they who, from the bordering flood 
+Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts 
+Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names 
+Of Baalim and Ashtaroth--those male, 
+These feminine. For Spirits, when they please, 
+Can either sex assume, or both; so soft 
+And uncompounded is their essence pure, 
+Not tried or manacled with joint or limb, 
+Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, 
+Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose, 
+Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure, 
+Can execute their airy purposes, 
+And works of love or enmity fulfil. 
+For those the race of Israel oft forsook 
+Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left 
+His righteous altar, bowing lowly down 
+To bestial gods; for which their heads as low 
+Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear 
+Of despicable foes. With these in troop 
+Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called 
+Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns; 
+To whose bright image nigntly by the moon 
+Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs; 
+In Sion also not unsung, where stood 
+Her temple on th' offensive mountain, built 
+By that uxorious king whose heart, though large, 
+Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell 
+To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, 
+Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured 
+The Syrian damsels to lament his fate 
+In amorous ditties all a summer's day, 
+While smooth Adonis from his native rock 
+Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood 
+Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale 
+Infected Sion's daughters with like heat, 
+Whose wanton passions in the sacred proch 
+Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led, 
+His eye surveyed the dark idolatries 
+Of alienated Judah. Next came one 
+Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark 
+Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off, 
+In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge, 
+Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers: 
+Dagon his name, sea-monster,upward man 
+And downward fish; yet had his temple high 
+Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast 
+Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon, 
+And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds. 
+Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat 
+Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks 
+Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. 
+He also against the house of God was bold: 
+A leper once he lost, and gained a king-- 
+Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew 
+God's altar to disparage and displace 
+For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn 
+His odious offerings, and adore the gods 
+Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared 
+A crew who, under names of old renown-- 
+Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train-- 
+With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused 
+Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek 
+Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms 
+Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape 
+Th' infection, when their borrowed gold composed 
+The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king 
+Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan, 
+Likening his Maker to the grazed ox-- 
+Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed 
+From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke 
+Both her first-born and all her bleating gods. 
+Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd 
+Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love 
+Vice for itself. To him no temple stood 
+Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he 
+In temples and at altars, when the priest 
+Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled 
+With lust and violence the house of God? 
+In courts and palaces he also reigns, 
+And in luxurious cities, where the noise 
+Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers, 
+And injury and outrage; and, when night 
+Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons 
+Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. 
+Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night 
+In Gibeah, when the hospitable door 
+Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape. 
+  These were the prime in order and in might: 
+The rest were long to tell; though far renowned 
+Th' Ionian gods--of Javan's issue held 
+Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth, 
+Their boasted parents;--Titan, Heaven's first-born, 
+With his enormous brood, and birthright seized 
+By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove, 
+His own and Rhea's son, like measure found; 
+So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete 
+And Ida known, thence on the snowy top 
+Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air, 
+Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff, 
+Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds 
+Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old 
+Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian fields, 
+And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles. 
+  All these and more came flocking; but with looks 
+Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared 
+Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief 
+Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost 
+In loss itself; which on his countenance cast 
+Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride 
+Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore 
+Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised 
+Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears. 
+Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound 
+Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared 
+His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed 
+Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall: 
+Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled 
+Th' imperial ensign; which, full high advanced, 
+Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind, 
+With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed, 
+Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while 
+Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds: 
+At which the universal host up-sent 
+A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond 
+Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night. 
+All in a moment through the gloom were seen 
+Ten thousand banners rise into the air, 
+With orient colours waving: with them rose 
+A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms 
+Appeared, and serried shields in thick array 
+Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move 
+In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood 
+Of flutes and soft recorders--such as raised 
+To height of noblest temper heroes old 
+Arming to battle, and instead of rage 
+Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved 
+With dread of death to flight or foul retreat; 
+Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage 
+With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase 
+Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain 
+From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they, 
+Breathing united force with fixed thought, 
+Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed 
+Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil. And now 
+Advanced in view they stand--a horrid front 
+Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise 
+Of warriors old, with ordered spear and shield, 
+Awaiting what command their mighty Chief 
+Had to impose. He through the armed files 
+Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse 
+The whole battalion views--their order due, 
+Their visages and stature as of gods; 
+Their number last he sums. And now his heart 
+Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength, 
+Glories: for never, since created Man, 
+Met such embodied force as, named with these, 
+Could merit more than that small infantry 
+Warred on by cranes--though all the giant brood 
+Of Phlegra with th' heroic race were joined 
+That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side 
+Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds 
+In fable or romance of Uther's son, 
+Begirt with British and Armoric knights; 
+And all who since, baptized or infidel, 
+Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban, 
+Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond, 
+Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore 
+When Charlemain with all his peerage fell 
+By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond 
+Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed 
+Their dread Commander. He, above the rest 
+In shape and gesture proudly eminent, 
+Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost 
+All her original brightness, nor appeared 
+Less than Archangel ruined, and th' excess 
+Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen 
+Looks through the horizontal misty air 
+Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon, 
+In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds 
+On half the nations, and with fear of change 
+Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone 
+Above them all th' Archangel: but his face 
+Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care 
+Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows 
+Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride 
+Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast 
+Signs of remorse and passion, to behold 
+The fellows of his crime, the followers rather 
+(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned 
+For ever now to have their lot in pain-- 
+Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced 
+Of Heaven, and from eteranl splendours flung 
+For his revolt--yet faithful how they stood, 
+Their glory withered; as, when heaven's fire 
+Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines, 
+With singed top their stately growth, though bare, 
+Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared 
+To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend 
+From wing to wing, and half enclose him round 
+With all his peers: attention held them mute. 
+Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn, 
+Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last 
+Words interwove with sighs found out their way:-- 
+  "O myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers 
+Matchless, but with th' Almighth!--and that strife 
+Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, 
+As this place testifies, and this dire change, 
+Hateful to utter. But what power of mind, 
+Forseeing or presaging, from the depth 
+Of knowledge past or present, could have feared 
+How such united force of gods, how such 
+As stood like these, could ever know repulse? 
+For who can yet believe, though after loss, 
+That all these puissant legions, whose exile 
+Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend, 
+Self-raised, and repossess their native seat? 
+For me, be witness all the host of Heaven, 
+If counsels different, or danger shunned 
+By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns 
+Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure 
+Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute, 
+Consent or custom, and his regal state 
+Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed-- 
+Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. 
+Henceforth his might we know, and know our own, 
+So as not either to provoke, or dread 
+New war provoked: our better part remains 
+To work in close design, by fraud or guile, 
+What force effected not; that he no less 
+At length from us may find, who overcomes 
+By force hath overcome but half his foe. 
+Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife 
+There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long 
+Intended to create, and therein plant 
+A generation whom his choice regard 
+Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven. 
+Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps 
+Our first eruption--thither, or elsewhere; 
+For this infernal pit shall never hold 
+Celestial Spirits in bondage, nor th' Abyss 
+Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts 
+Full counsel must mature. Peace is despaired; 
+For who can think submission? War, then, war 
+Open or understood, must be resolved." 
+  He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew 
+Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs 
+Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze 
+Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged 
+Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms 
+Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war, 
+Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven. 
+  There stood a hill not far, whose grisly top 
+Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire 
+Shone with a glossy scurf--undoubted sign 
+That in his womb was hid metallic ore, 
+The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed, 
+A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands 
+Of pioneers, with spade and pickaxe armed, 
+Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field, 
+Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on-- 
+Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell 
+From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts 
+Were always downward bent, admiring more 
+The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold, 
+Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed 
+In vision beatific. By him first 
+Men also, and by his suggestion taught, 
+Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands 
+Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth 
+For treasures better hid. Soon had his crew 
+Opened into the hill a spacious wound, 
+And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire 
+That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best 
+Deserve the precious bane. And here let those 
+Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell 
+Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings, 
+Learn how their greatest monuments of fame 
+And strength, and art, are easily outdone 
+By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour 
+What in an age they, with incessant toil 
+And hands innumerable, scarce perform. 
+Nigh on the plain, in many cells prepared, 
+That underneath had veins of liquid fire 
+Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude 
+With wondrous art founded the massy ore, 
+Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross. 
+A third as soon had formed within the ground 
+A various mould, and from the boiling cells 
+By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook; 
+As in an organ, from one blast of wind, 
+To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes. 
+Anon out of the earth a fabric huge 
+Rose like an exhalation, with the sound 
+Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet-- 
+Built like a temple, where pilasters round 
+Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid 
+With golden architrave; nor did there want 
+Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven; 
+The roof was fretted gold. Not Babylon 
+Nor great Alcairo such magnificence 
+Equalled in all their glories, to enshrine 
+Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat 
+Their kings, when Egypt with Assyria strove 
+In wealth and luxury. Th' ascending pile 
+Stood fixed her stately height, and straight the doors, 
+Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide 
+Within, her ample spaces o'er the smooth 
+And level pavement: from the arched roof, 
+Pendent by subtle magic, many a row 
+Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed 
+With naptha and asphaltus, yielded light 
+As from a sky. The hasty multitude 
+Admiring entered; and the work some praise, 
+And some the architect. His hand was known 
+In Heaven by many a towered structure high, 
+Where sceptred Angels held their residence, 
+And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King 
+Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, 
+Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright. 
+Nor was his name unheard or unadored 
+In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land 
+Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell 
+From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove 
+Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn 
+To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, 
+A summer's day, and with the setting sun 
+Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star, 
+On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate, 
+Erring; for he with this rebellious rout 
+Fell long before; nor aught aviled him now 
+To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape 
+By all his engines, but was headlong sent, 
+With his industrious crew, to build in Hell. 
+  Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by command 
+Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony 
+And trumpet's sound, throughout the host proclaim 
+A solemn council forthwith to be held 
+At Pandemonium, the high capital 
+Of Satan and his peers. Their summons called 
+From every band and squared regiment 
+By place or choice the worthiest: they anon 
+With hundreds and with thousands trooping came 
+Attended. All access was thronged; the gates 
+And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall 
+(Though like a covered field, where champions bold 
+Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair 
+Defied the best of Paynim chivalry 
+To mortal combat, or career with lance), 
+Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air, 
+Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees 
+In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides. 
+Pour forth their populous youth about the hive 
+In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers 
+Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank, 
+The suburb of their straw-built citadel, 
+New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer 
+Their state-affairs: so thick the airy crowd 
+Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given, 
+Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed 
+In bigness to surpass Earth's giant sons, 
+Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room 
+Throng numberless--like that pygmean race 
+Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves, 
+Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side 
+Or fountain, some belated peasant sees, 
+Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon 
+Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth 
+Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance 
+Intent, with jocund music charm his ear; 
+At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. 
+Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms 
+Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large, 
+Though without number still, amidst the hall 
+Of that infernal court. But far within, 
+And in their own dimensions like themselves, 
+The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim 
+In close recess and secret conclave sat, 
+A thousand demi-gods on golden seats, 
+Frequent and full. After short silence then, 
+And summons read, the great consult began.

+  
+High on a throne of royal state, which far 
+Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind, 
+Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand 
+Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold, 
+Satan exalted sat, by merit raised 
+To that bad eminence; and, from despair 
+Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires 
+Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue 
+Vain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught, 
+His proud imaginations thus displayed:-- 
+  "Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!-- 
+For, since no deep within her gulf can hold 
+Immortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen, 
+I give not Heaven for lost: from this descent 
+Celestial Virtues rising will appear 
+More glorious and more dread than from no fall, 
+And trust themselves to fear no second fate!-- 
+Me though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven, 
+Did first create your leader--next, free choice 
+With what besides in council or in fight 
+Hath been achieved of merit--yet this loss, 
+Thus far at least recovered, hath much more 
+Established in a safe, unenvied throne, 
+Yielded with full consent. The happier state 
+In Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw 
+Envy from each inferior; but who here 
+Will envy whom the highest place exposes 
+Foremost to stand against the Thunderer's aim 
+Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share 
+Of endless pain? Where there is, then, no good 
+For which to strive, no strife can grow up there 
+From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell 
+Precedence; none whose portion is so small 
+Of present pain that with ambitious mind 
+Will covet more! With this advantage, then, 
+To union, and firm faith, and firm accord, 
+More than can be in Heaven, we now return 
+To claim our just inheritance of old, 
+Surer to prosper than prosperity 
+Could have assured us; and by what best way, 
+Whether of open war or covert guile, 
+We now debate. Who can advise may speak." 
+  He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king, 
+Stood up--the strongest and the fiercest Spirit 
+That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair. 
+His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed 
+Equal in strength, and rather than be less 
+Cared not to be at all; with that care lost 
+Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse, 
+He recked not, and these words thereafter spake:-- 
+  "My sentence is for open war. Of wiles, 
+More unexpert, I boast not: them let those 
+Contrive who need, or when they need; not now. 
+For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest-- 
+Millions that stand in arms, and longing wait 
+The signal to ascend--sit lingering here, 
+Heaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place 
+Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame, 
+The prison of his ryranny who reigns 
+By our delay? No! let us rather choose, 
+Armed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once 
+O'er Heaven's high towers to force resistless way, 
+Turning our tortures into horrid arms 
+Against the Torturer; when, to meet the noise 
+Of his almighty engine, he shall hear 
+Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see 
+Black fire and horror shot with equal rage 
+Among his Angels, and his throne itself 
+Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire, 
+His own invented torments. But perhaps 
+The way seems difficult, and steep to scale 
+With upright wing against a higher foe! 
+Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench 
+Of that forgetful lake benumb not still, 
+That in our porper motion we ascend 
+Up to our native seat; descent and fall 
+To us is adverse. Who but felt of late, 
+When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear 
+Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep, 
+With what compulsion and laborious flight 
+We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy, then; 
+Th' event is feared! Should we again provoke 
+Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find 
+To our destruction, if there be in Hell 
+Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse 
+Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned 
+In this abhorred deep to utter woe! 
+Where pain of unextinguishable fire 
+Must exercise us without hope of end 
+The vassals of his anger, when the scourge 
+Inexorably, and the torturing hour, 
+Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus, 
+We should be quite abolished, and expire. 
+What fear we then? what doubt we to incense 
+His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged, 
+Will either quite consume us, and reduce 
+To nothing this essential--happier far 
+Than miserable to have eternal being!-- 
+Or, if our substance be indeed divine, 
+And cannot cease to be, we are at worst 
+On this side nothing; and by proof we feel 
+Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven, 
+And with perpetual inroads to alarm, 
+Though inaccessible, his fatal throne: 
+Which, if not victory, is yet revenge." 
+  He ended frowning, and his look denounced 
+Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous 
+To less than gods. On th' other side up rose 
+Belial, in act more graceful and humane. 
+A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed 
+For dignity composed, and high exploit. 
+But all was false and hollow; though his tongue 
+Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear 
+The better reason, to perplex and dash 
+Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low-- 
+ To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds 
+Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear, 
+And with persuasive accent thus began:-- 
+  "I should be much for open war, O Peers, 
+As not behind in hate, if what was urged 
+Main reason to persuade immediate war 
+Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast 
+Ominous conjecture on the whole success; 
+When he who most excels in fact of arms, 
+In what he counsels and in what excels 
+Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair 
+And utter dissolution, as the scope 
+Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. 
+First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled 
+With armed watch, that render all access 
+Impregnable: oft on the bodering Deep 
+Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing 
+Scout far and wide into the realm of Night, 
+Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way 
+By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise 
+With blackest insurrection to confound 
+Heaven's purest light, yet our great Enemy, 
+All incorruptible, would on his throne 
+Sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould, 
+Incapable of stain, would soon expel 
+Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire, 
+Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope 
+Is flat despair: we must exasperate 
+Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage; 
+And that must end us; that must be our cure-- 
+To be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose, 
+Though full of pain, this intellectual being, 
+Those thoughts that wander through eternity, 
+To perish rather, swallowed up and lost 
+In the wide womb of uncreated Night, 
+Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows, 
+Let this be good, whether our angry Foe 
+Can give it, or will ever? How he can 
+Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. 
+Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, 
+Belike through impotence or unaware, 
+To give his enemies their wish, and end 
+Them in his anger whom his anger saves 
+To punish endless? 'Wherefore cease we, then?' 
+Say they who counsel war; 'we are decreed, 
+Reserved, and destined to eternal woe; 
+Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, 
+What can we suffer worse?' Is this, then, worst-- 
+Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms? 
+What when we fled amain, pursued and struck 
+With Heaven's afflicting thunder, and besought 
+The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed 
+A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay 
+Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse. 
+What if the breath that kindled those grim fires, 
+Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage, 
+And plunge us in the flames; or from above 
+Should intermitted vengeance arm again 
+His red right hand to plague us? What if all 
+Her stores were opened, and this firmament 
+Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire, 
+Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall 
+One day upon our heads; while we perhaps, 
+Designing or exhorting glorious war, 
+Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled, 
+Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey 
+Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk 
+Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains, 
+There to converse with everlasting groans, 
+Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved, 
+Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse. 
+War, therefore, open or concealed, alike 
+My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile 
+With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye 
+Views all things at one view? He from Heaven's height 
+All these our motions vain sees and derides, 
+Not more almighty to resist our might 
+Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. 
+Shall we, then, live thus vile--the race of Heaven 
+Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here 
+Chains and these torments? Better these than worse, 
+By my advice; since fate inevitable 
+Subdues us, and omnipotent decree, 
+The Victor's will. To suffer, as to do, 
+Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust 
+That so ordains. This was at first resolved, 
+If we were wise, against so great a foe 
+Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. 
+I laugh when those who at the spear are bold 
+And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear 
+What yet they know must follow--to endure 
+Exile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain, 
+The sentence of their Conqueror. This is now 
+Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, 
+Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit 
+His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed, 
+Not mind us not offending, satisfied 
+With what is punished; whence these raging fires 
+Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames. 
+Our purer essence then will overcome 
+Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel; 
+Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed 
+In temper and in nature, will receive 
+Familiar the fierce heat; and, void of pain, 
+This horror will grow mild, this darkness light; 
+Besides what hope the never-ending flight 
+Of future days may bring, what chance, what change 
+Worth waiting--since our present lot appears 
+For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, 
+If we procure not to ourselves more woe." 
+  Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb, 
+Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth, 
+Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:-- 
+  "Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven 
+We war, if war be best, or to regain 
+Our own right lost. Him to unthrone we then 
+May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield 
+To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife. 
+The former, vain to hope, argues as vain 
+The latter; for what place can be for us 
+Within Heaven's bound, unless Heaven's Lord supreme 
+We overpower? Suppose he should relent 
+And publish grace to all, on promise made 
+Of new subjection; with what eyes could we 
+Stand in his presence humble, and receive 
+Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne 
+With warbled hyms, and to his Godhead sing 
+Forced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits 
+Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes 
+Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers, 
+Our servile offerings? This must be our task 
+In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome 
+Eternity so spent in worship paid 
+To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue, 
+By force impossible, by leave obtained 
+Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state 
+Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek 
+Our own good from ourselves, and from our own 
+Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess, 
+Free and to none accountable, preferring 
+Hard liberty before the easy yoke 
+Of servile pomp. Our greatness will appear 
+Then most conspicuous when great things of small, 
+Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse, 
+We can create, and in what place soe'er 
+Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain 
+Through labour and endurance. This deep world 
+Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst 
+Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven's all-ruling Sire 
+Choose to reside, his glory unobscured, 
+And with the majesty of darkness round 
+Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar. 
+Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell! 
+As he our darkness, cannot we his light 
+Imitate when we please? This desert soil 
+Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold; 
+Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise 
+Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more? 
+Our torments also may, in length of time, 
+Become our elements, these piercing fires 
+As soft as now severe, our temper changed 
+Into their temper; which must needs remove 
+The sensible of pain. All things invite 
+To peaceful counsels, and the settled state 
+Of order, how in safety best we may 
+Compose our present evils, with regard 
+Of what we are and where, dismissing quite 
+All thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise." 
+  He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled 
+Th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain 
+The sound of blustering winds, which all night long 
+Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull 
+Seafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance 
+Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay 
+After the tempest. Such applause was heard 
+As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased, 
+Advising peace: for such another field 
+They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear 
+Of thunder and the sword of Michael 
+Wrought still within them; and no less desire 
+To found this nether empire, which might rise, 
+By policy and long process of time, 
+In emulation opposite to Heaven. 
+Which when Beelzebub perceived--than whom, 
+Satan except, none higher sat--with grave 
+Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed 
+A pillar of state. Deep on his front engraven 
+Deliberation sat, and public care; 
+And princely counsel in his face yet shone, 
+Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood 
+With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear 
+The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look 
+Drew audience and attention still as night 
+Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake:-- 
+  "Thrones and Imperial Powers, Offspring of Heaven, 
+Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now 
+Must we renounce, and, changing style, be called 
+Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote 
+Inclines--here to continue, and build up here 
+A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream, 
+And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed 
+This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat 
+Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt 
+From Heaven's high jurisdiction, in new league 
+Banded against his throne, but to remain 
+In strictest bondage, though thus far removed, 
+Under th' inevitable curb, reserved 
+His captive multitude. For he, to be sure, 
+In height or depth, still first and last will reign 
+Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part 
+By our revolt, but over Hell extend 
+His empire, and with iron sceptre rule 
+Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven. 
+What sit we then projecting peace and war? 
+War hath determined us and foiled with loss 
+Irreparable; terms of peace yet none 
+Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given 
+To us enslaved, but custody severe, 
+And stripes and arbitrary punishment 
+Inflicted? and what peace can we return, 
+But, to our power, hostility and hate, 
+Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow, 
+Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least 
+May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice 
+In doing what we most in suffering feel? 
+Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need 
+With dangerous expedition to invade 
+Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, 
+Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find 
+Some easier enterprise? There is a place 
+(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven 
+Err not)--another World, the happy seat 
+Of some new race, called Man, about this time 
+To be created like to us, though less 
+In power and excellence, but favoured more 
+Of him who rules above; so was his will 
+Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath 
+That shook Heaven's whole circumference confirmed. 
+Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn 
+What creatures there inhabit, of what mould 
+Or substance, how endued, and what their power 
+And where their weakness: how attempted best, 
+By force of subtlety. Though Heaven be shut, 
+And Heaven's high Arbitrator sit secure 
+In his own strength, this place may lie exposed, 
+The utmost border of his kingdom, left 
+To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps, 
+Some advantageous act may be achieved 
+By sudden onset--either with Hell-fire 
+To waste his whole creation, or possess 
+All as our own, and drive, as we were driven, 
+The puny habitants; or, if not drive, 
+Seduce them to our party, that their God 
+May prove their foe, and with repenting hand 
+Abolish his own works. This would surpass 
+Common revenge, and interrupt his joy 
+In our confusion, and our joy upraise 
+In his disturbance; when his darling sons, 
+Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse 
+Their frail original, and faded bliss-- 
+Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth 
+Attempting, or to sit in darkness here 
+Hatching vain empires." Thus beelzebub 
+Pleaded his devilish counsel--first devised 
+By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence, 
+But from the author of all ill, could spring 
+So deep a malice, to confound the race 
+Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell 
+To mingle and involve, done all to spite 
+The great Creator? But their spite still serves 
+His glory to augment. The bold design 
+Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy 
+Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent 
+They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:-- 
+"Well have ye judged, well ended long debate, 
+Synod of Gods, and, like to what ye are, 
+Great things resolved, which from the lowest deep 
+Will once more lift us up, in spite of fate, 
+Nearer our ancient seat--perhaps in view 
+Of those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms, 
+And opportune excursion, we may chance 
+Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone 
+Dwell, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light, 
+Secure, and at the brightening orient beam 
+Purge off this gloom: the soft delicious air, 
+To heal the scar of these corrosive fires, 
+Shall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send 
+In search of this new World? whom shall we find 
+Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet 
+The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss, 
+And through the palpable obscure find out 
+His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight, 
+Upborne with indefatigable wings 
+Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive 
+The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then 
+Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe, 
+Through the strict senteries and stations thick 
+Of Angels watching round? Here he had need 
+All circumspection: and we now no less 
+Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send 
+The weight of all, and our last hope, relies." 
+  This said, he sat; and expectation held 
+His look suspense, awaiting who appeared 
+To second, or oppose, or undertake 
+The perilous attempt. But all sat mute, 
+Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each 
+In other's countenance read his own dismay, 
+Astonished. None among the choice and prime 
+Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found 
+So hardy as to proffer or accept, 
+Alone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last, 
+Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised 
+Above his fellows, with monarchal pride 
+Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:-- 
+  "O Progeny of Heaven! Empyreal Thrones! 
+With reason hath deep silence and demur 
+Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way 
+And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light. 
+Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, 
+Outrageous to devour, immures us round 
+Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant, 
+Barred over us, prohibit all egress. 
+These passed, if any pass, the void profound 
+Of unessential Night receives him next, 
+Wide-gaping, and with utter loss of being 
+Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf. 
+If thence he scape, into whatever world, 
+Or unknown region, what remains him less 
+Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape? 
+But I should ill become this throne, O Peers, 
+And this imperial sovereignty, adorned 
+With splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed 
+And judged of public moment in the shape 
+Of difficulty or danger, could deter 
+Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume 
+These royalties, and not refuse to reign, 
+Refusing to accept as great a share 
+Of hazard as of honour, due alike 
+To him who reigns, and so much to him due 
+Of hazard more as he above the rest 
+High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers, 
+Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home, 
+While here shall be our home, what best may ease 
+The present misery, and render Hell 
+More tolerable; if there be cure or charm 
+To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain 
+Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch 
+Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad 
+Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek 
+Deliverance for us all. This enterprise 
+None shall partake with me." Thus saying, rose 
+The Monarch, and prevented all reply; 
+Prudent lest, from his resolution raised, 
+Others among the chief might offer now, 
+Certain to be refused, what erst they feared, 
+And, so refused, might in opinion stand 
+His rivals, winning cheap the high repute 
+Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they 
+Dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice 
+Forbidding; and at once with him they rose. 
+Their rising all at once was as the sound 
+Of thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend 
+With awful reverence prone, and as a God 
+Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven. 
+Nor failed they to express how much they praised 
+That for the general safety he despised 
+His own: for neither do the Spirits damned 
+Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast 
+Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, 
+Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal. 
+  Thus they their doubtful consultations dark 
+Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief: 
+As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds 
+Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread 
+Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element 
+Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower, 
+If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet, 
+Extend his evening beam, the fields revive, 
+The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds 
+Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings. 
+O shame to men! Devil with devil damned 
+Firm concord holds; men only disagree 
+Of creatures rational, though under hope 
+Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace, 
+Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife 
+Among themselves, and levy cruel wars 
+Wasting the earth, each other to destroy: 
+As if (which might induce us to accord) 
+Man had not hellish foes enow besides, 
+That day and night for his destruction wait! 
+  The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth 
+In order came the grand infernal Peers: 
+Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed 
+Alone th' antagonist of Heaven, nor less 
+Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme, 
+And god-like imitated state: him round 
+A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed 
+With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms. 
+Then of their session ended they bid cry 
+With trumpet's regal sound the great result: 
+Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim 
+Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy, 
+By herald's voice explained; the hollow Abyss 
+Heard far adn wide, and all the host of Hell 
+With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim. 
+Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised 
+By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers 
+Disband; and, wandering, each his several way 
+Pursues, as inclination or sad choice 
+Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find 
+Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain 
+The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. 
+Part on the plain, or in the air sublime, 
+Upon the wing or in swift race contend, 
+As at th' Olympian games or Pythian fields; 
+Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal 
+With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form: 
+As when, to warn proud cities, war appears 
+Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush 
+To battle in the clouds; before each van 
+Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears, 
+Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms 
+From either end of heaven the welkin burns. 
+Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell, 
+Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air 
+In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:-- 
+As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned 
+With conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and tore 
+Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines, 
+And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw 
+Into th' Euboic sea. Others, more mild, 
+Retreated in a silent valley, sing 
+With notes angelical to many a harp 
+Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall 
+By doom of battle, and complain that Fate 
+Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance. 
+Their song was partial; but the harmony 
+(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) 
+Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment 
+The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet 
+(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense) 
+Others apart sat on a hill retired, 
+In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high 
+Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate-- 
+Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, 
+And found no end, in wandering mazes lost. 
+Of good and evil much they argued then, 
+Of happiness and final misery, 
+Passion and apathy, and glory and shame: 
+Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!-- 
+Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm 
+Pain for a while or anguish, and excite 
+Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast 
+With stubborn patience as with triple steel. 
+Another part, in squadrons and gross bands, 
+On bold adventure to discover wide 
+That dismal world, if any clime perhaps 
+Might yield them easier habitation, bend 
+Four ways their flying march, along the banks 
+Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge 
+Into the burning lake their baleful streams-- 
+Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate; 
+Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; 
+Cocytus, named of lamentation loud 
+Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton, 
+Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. 
+Far off from these, a slow and silent stream, 
+Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls 
+Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks 
+Forthwith his former state and being forgets-- 
+Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. 
+Beyond this flood a frozen continent 
+Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms 
+Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land 
+Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems 
+Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, 
+A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog 
+Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, 
+Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air 
+Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire. 
+Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled, 
+At certain revolutions all the damned 
+Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change 
+Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce, 
+From beds of raging fire to starve in ice 
+Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine 
+Immovable, infixed, and frozen round 
+Periods of time,--thence hurried back to fire. 
+They ferry over this Lethean sound 
+Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment, 
+And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach 
+The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose 
+In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, 
+All in one moment, and so near the brink; 
+But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th' attempt, 
+Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards 
+The ford, and of itself the water flies 
+All taste of living wight, as once it fled 
+The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on 
+In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands, 
+With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast, 
+Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found 
+No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale 
+They passed, and many a region dolorous, 
+O'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp, 
+Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death-- 
+A universe of death, which God by curse 
+Created evil, for evil only good; 
+Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, 
+Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, 
+Obominable, inutterable, and worse 
+Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived, 
+Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire. 
+  Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man, 
+Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design, 
+Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell 
+Explores his solitary flight: sometimes 
+He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left; 
+Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars 
+Up to the fiery concave towering high. 
+As when far off at sea a fleet descried 
+Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds 
+Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles 
+Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring 
+Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood, 
+Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape, 
+Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed 
+Far off the flying Fiend. At last appear 
+Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof, 
+And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass, 
+Three iron, three of adamantine rock, 
+Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire, 
+Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat 
+On either side a formidable Shape. 
+The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair, 
+But ended foul in many a scaly fold, 
+Voluminous and vast--a serpent armed 
+With mortal sting. About her middle round 
+A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked 
+With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung 
+A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep, 
+If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb, 
+And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled 
+Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these 
+Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts 
+Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore; 
+Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called 
+In secret, riding through the air she comes, 
+Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance 
+With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon 
+Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape-- 
+If shape it might be called that shape had none 
+Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb; 
+Or substance might be called that shadow seemed, 
+For each seemed either--black it stood as Night, 
+Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, 
+And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head 
+The likeness of a kingly crown had on. 
+Satan was now at hand, and from his seat 
+The monster moving onward came as fast 
+With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode. 
+Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired-- 
+Admired, not feared (God and his Son except, 
+Created thing naught valued he nor shunned), 
+And with disdainful look thus first began:-- 
+  "Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape, 
+That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance 
+Thy miscreated front athwart my way 
+To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass, 
+That be assured, without leave asked of thee. 
+Retire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, 
+Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven." 
+  To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied:-- 
+"Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he, 
+Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then 
+Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms 
+Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons, 
+Conjured against the Highest--for which both thou 
+And they, outcast from God, are here condemned 
+To waste eternal days in woe and pain? 
+And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven 
+Hell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn, 
+Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more, 
+Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment, 
+False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings, 
+Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue 
+Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart 
+Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before." 
+  So spake the grisly Terror, and in shape, 
+So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold, 
+More dreadful and deform. On th' other side, 
+Incensed with indignation, Satan stood 
+Unterrified, and like a comet burned, 
+That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge 
+In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair 
+Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head 
+Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands 
+No second stroke intend; and such a frown 
+Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds, 
+With heaven's artillery fraught, came rattling on 
+Over the Caspian,--then stand front to front 
+Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow 
+To join their dark encounter in mid-air. 
+So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell 
+Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood; 
+For never but once more was wither like 
+To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds 
+Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung, 
+Had not the snaky Sorceress, that sat 
+Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key, 
+Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between. 
+  "O father, what intends thy hand," she cried, 
+"Against thy only son? What fury, O son, 
+Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart 
+Against thy father's head? And know'st for whom? 
+For him who sits above, and laughs the while 
+At thee, ordained his drudge to execute 
+Whate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids-- 
+His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!" 
+  She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest 
+Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:-- 
+  "So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange 
+Thou interposest, that my sudden hand, 
+Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds 
+What it intends, till first I know of thee 
+What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why, 
+In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st 
+Me father, and that phantasm call'st my son. 
+I know thee not, nor ever saw till now 
+Sight more detestable than him and thee." 
+  T' whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied:-- 
+"Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem 
+Now in thine eye so foul?--once deemed so fair 
+In Heaven, when at th' assembly, and in sight 
+Of all the Seraphim with thee combined 
+In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King, 
+All on a sudden miserable pain 
+Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum 
+In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast 
+Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide, 
+Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright, 
+Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed, 
+Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized 
+All th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid 
+At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign 
+Portentous held me; but, familiar grown, 
+I pleased, and with attractive graces won 
+The most averse--thee chiefly, who, full oft 
+Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing, 
+Becam'st enamoured; and such joy thou took'st 
+With me in secret that my womb conceived 
+A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose, 
+And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained 
+(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe 
+Clear victory; to our part loss and rout 
+Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell, 
+Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down 
+Into this Deep; and in the general fall 
+I also: at which time this powerful key 
+Into my hands was given, with charge to keep 
+These gates for ever shut, which none can pass 
+Without my opening. Pensive here I sat 
+Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb, 
+Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown, 
+Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. 
+At last this odious offspring whom thou seest, 
+Thine own begotten, breaking violent way, 
+Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain 
+Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew 
+Transformed: but he my inbred enemy 
+Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart, 
+Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death! 
+Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed 
+From all her caves, and back resounded Death! 
+I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems, 
+Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far, 
+Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed, 
+And, in embraces forcible and foul 
+Engendering with me, of that rape begot 
+These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry 
+Surround me, as thou saw'st--hourly conceived 
+And hourly born, with sorrow infinite 
+To me; for, when they list, into the womb 
+That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw 
+My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth 
+Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round, 
+That rest or intermission none I find. 
+Before mine eyes in opposition sits 
+Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on, 
+And me, his parent, would full soon devour 
+For want of other prey, but that he knows 
+His end with mine involved, and knows that I 
+Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane, 
+Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced. 
+But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun 
+His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope 
+To be invulnerable in those bright arms, 
+Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint, 
+Save he who reigns above, none can resist." 
+  She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore 
+Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth:-- 
+  "Dear daughter--since thou claim'st me for thy sire, 
+And my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge 
+Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys 
+Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change 
+Befallen us unforeseen, unthought-of--know, 
+I come no enemy, but to set free 
+From out this dark and dismal house of pain 
+Both him and thee, and all the heavenly host 
+Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed, 
+Fell with us from on high. From them I go 
+This uncouth errand sole, and one for all 
+Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread 
+Th' unfounded Deep, and through the void immense 
+To search, with wandering quest, a place foretold 
+Should be--and, by concurring signs, ere now 
+Created vast and round--a place of bliss 
+In the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed 
+A race of upstart creatures, to supply 
+Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed, 
+Lest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude, 
+Might hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught 
+Than this more secret, now designed, I haste 
+To know; and, this once known, shall soon return, 
+And bring ye to the place where thou and Death 
+Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen 
+Wing silently the buxom air, embalmed 
+With odours. There ye shall be fed and filled 
+Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey." 
+  He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased, and Death 
+Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear 
+His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw 
+Destined to that good hour. No less rejoiced 
+His mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:-- 
+  "The key of this infernal Pit, by due 
+And by command of Heaven's all-powerful King, 
+I keep, by him forbidden to unlock 
+These adamantine gates; against all force 
+Death ready stands to interpose his dart, 
+Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might. 
+But what owe I to his commands above, 
+Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down 
+Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, 
+To sit in hateful office here confined, 
+Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born-- 
+Here in perpetual agony and pain, 
+With terrors and with clamours compassed round 
+Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed? 
+Thou art my father, thou my author, thou 
+My being gav'st me; whom should I obey 
+But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon 
+To that new world of light and bliss, among 
+The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign 
+At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems 
+Thy daughter and thy darling, without end." 
+  Thus saying, from her side the fatal key, 
+Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; 
+And, towards the gate rolling her bestial train, 
+Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew, 
+Which, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers 
+Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns 
+Th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar 
+Of massy iron or solid rock with ease 
+Unfastens. On a sudden open fly, 
+With impetuous recoil and jarring sound, 
+Th' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate 
+Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook 
+Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut 
+Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood, 
+That with extended wings a bannered host, 
+Under spread ensigns marching, mibht pass through 
+With horse and chariots ranked in loose array; 
+So wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth 
+Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame. 
+Before their eyes in sudden view appear 
+The secrets of the hoary Deep--a dark 
+Illimitable ocean, without bound, 
+Without dimension; where length, breadth, and height, 
+And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night 
+And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold 
+Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise 
+Of endless wars, and by confusion stand. 
+For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce, 
+Strive here for mastery, and to battle bring 
+Their embryon atoms: they around the flag 
+Of each his faction, in their several clans, 
+Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow, 
+Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands 
+Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, 
+Levied to side with warring winds, and poise 
+Their lighter wings. To whom these most adhere 
+He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits, 
+And by decision more embroils the fray 
+By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter, 
+Chance governs all. Into this wild Abyss, 
+The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave, 
+Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, 
+But all these in their pregnant causes mixed 
+Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight, 
+Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain 
+His dark materials to create more worlds-- 
+Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend 
+Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while, 
+Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith 
+He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed 
+With noises loud and ruinous (to compare 
+Great things with small) than when Bellona storms 
+With all her battering engines, bent to rase 
+Some capital city; or less than if this frame 
+Of Heaven were falling, and these elements 
+In mutiny had from her axle torn 
+The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans 
+He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke 
+Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league, 
+As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides 
+Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets 
+A vast vacuity. All unawares, 
+Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops 
+Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour 
+Down had been falling, had not, by ill chance, 
+The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud, 
+Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him 
+As many miles aloft. That fury stayed-- 
+Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea, 
+Nor good dry land--nigh foundered, on he fares, 
+Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, 
+Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail. 
+As when a gryphon through the wilderness 
+With winged course, o'er hill or moory dale, 
+Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth 
+Had from his wakeful custody purloined 
+The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend 
+O'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, 
+With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way, 
+And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies. 
+At length a universal hubbub wild 
+Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused, 
+Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear 
+With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies 
+Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power 
+Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss 
+Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask 
+Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies 
+Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne 
+Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread 
+Wide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned 
+Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things, 
+The consort of his reign; and by them stood 
+Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name 
+Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance, 
+And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled, 
+And Discord with a thousand various mouths. 
+  T' whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:--"Ye Powers 
+And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss, 
+Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy 
+With purpose to explore or to disturb 
+The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint 
+Wandering this darksome desert, as my way 
+Lies through your spacious empire up to light, 
+Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek, 
+What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds 
+Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place, 
+From your dominion won, th' Ethereal King 
+Possesses lately, thither to arrive 
+I travel this profound. Direct my course: 
+Directed, no mean recompense it brings 
+To your behoof, if I that region lost, 
+All usurpation thence expelled, reduce 
+To her original darkness and your sway 
+(Which is my present journey), and once more 
+Erect the standard there of ancient Night. 
+Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge!" 
+  Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old, 
+With faltering speech and visage incomposed, 
+Answered:  "I know thee, stranger, who thou art--  *** 
+That mighty leading Angel, who of late 
+Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown. 
+I saw and heard; for such a numerous host 
+Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep, 
+With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, 
+Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates 
+Poured out by millions her victorious bands, 
+Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here 
+Keep residence; if all I can will serve 
+That little which is left so to defend, 
+Encroached on still through our intestine broils 
+Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell, 
+Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath; 
+Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world 
+Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain 
+To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell! 
+If that way be your walk, you have not far; 
+So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed; 
+Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain." 
+  He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply, 
+But, glad that now his sea should find a shore, 
+With fresh alacrity and force renewed 
+Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire, 
+Into the wild expanse, and through the shock 
+Of fighting elements, on all sides round 
+Environed, wins his way; harder beset 
+And more endangered than when Argo passed 
+Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks, 
+Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned 
+Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steered. 
+So he with difficulty and labour hard 
+Moved on, with difficulty and labour he; 
+But, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell, 
+Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain, 
+Following his track (such was the will of Heaven) 
+Paved after him a broad and beaten way 
+Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf 
+Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length, 
+From Hell continued, reaching th' utmost orb 
+Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse 
+With easy intercourse pass to and fro 
+To tempt or punish mortals, except whom 
+God and good Angels guard by special grace. 
+  But now at last the sacred influence 
+Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven 
+Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night 
+A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins 
+Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire, 
+As from her outmost works, a broken foe, 
+With tumult less and with less hostile din; 
+That Satan with less toil, and now with ease, 
+Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light, 
+And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds 
+Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; 
+Or in the emptier waste, resembling air, 
+Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold 
+Far off th' empyreal Heaven, extended wide 
+In circuit, undetermined square or round, 
+With opal towers and battlements adorned 
+Of living sapphire, once his native seat; 
+And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain, 
+This pendent World, in bigness as a star 
+Of smallest magnitude close by the moon. 
+Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge, 
+Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies. 
+

+ 
+ 
+Hail, holy Light, offspring of Heaven firstborn, 
+Or of the Eternal coeternal beam 
+May I express thee unblam'd?  since God is light, 
+And never but in unapproached light 
+Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee 
+Bright effluence of bright essence increate. 
+Or hear"st thou rather pure ethereal stream, 
+Whose fountain who shall tell?  before the sun, 
+Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice 
+Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest  *** 
+The rising world of waters dark and deep, 
+Won from the void and formless infinite. 
+Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, 
+Escap'd the Stygian pool, though long detain'd 
+In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight 
+Through utter and through middle darkness borne, 
+With other notes than to the Orphean lyre 
+I sung of Chaos and eternal Night; 
+Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down 
+The dark descent, and up to re-ascend, 
+Though hard and rare:  Thee I revisit safe, 
+And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou 
+Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in vain 
+To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; 
+So  thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs, 
+Or dim suffusion veil'd.  Yet not the more 
+Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt, 
+Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill, 
+Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief 
+Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath, 
+That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow, 
+Nightly I visit:  nor sometimes forget 
+So were I equall'd with them in renown, 
+Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace; 
+Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides, 
+And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old: 
+Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move 
+Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird 
+Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid 
+Tunes her nocturnal note.  Thus with the year 
+Seasons return; but not to me returns 
+Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn, 
+Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose, 
+Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine; 
+But cloud instead, and ever-during dark 
+Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men 
+Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair 
+Presented with a universal blank 
+Of nature's works to me expung'd and ras'd, 
+And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out. 
+So much the rather thou, celestial Light, 
+Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers 
+Irradiate; there plant eyes, all mist from thence 
+Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell 
+Of things invisible to mortal sight. 
+Now had the Almighty Father from above, 
+From the pure empyrean where he sits 
+High thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye 
+His own works and their works at once to view: 
+About him all the Sanctities of Heaven 
+Stood thick as stars, and from his sight receiv'd 
+Beatitude past utterance; on his right 
+The radiant image of his glory sat, 
+His only son; on earth he first beheld 
+Our two first parents, yet the only two 
+Of mankind in the happy garden plac'd 
+Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, 
+Uninterrupted joy, unrivall'd love, 
+In blissful solitude; he then survey'd 
+Hell and the gulf between, and Satan there  
+Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night 
+In the dun air sublime, and ready now 
+To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet, 
+On the bare outside of this world, that seem'd 
+Firm land imbosom'd, without firmament, 
+Uncertain which, in ocean or in air. 
+Him God beholding from his prospect high, 
+Wherein past, present, future, he beholds, 
+Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake. 
+Only begotten Son, seest thou what rage 
+Transports our Adversary?  whom no bounds 
+Prescrib'd no bars of Hell, nor all the chains 
+Heap'd on him there, nor yet the main abyss 
+Wide interrupt, can hold; so bent he seems 
+On desperate revenge, that shall redound 
+Upon his own rebellious head.  And now, 
+Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way 
+Not far off Heaven, in the precincts of light, 
+Directly towards the new created world, 
+And man there plac'd, with purpose to assay 
+If him by force he can destroy, or, worse, 
+By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert; 
+For man will hearken to his glozing lies, 
+And easily transgress the sole command, 
+Sole pledge of his obedience:  So will fall 
+He and his faithless progeny:  Whose fault? 
+Whose but his own?  ingrate, he had of me 
+All he could have; I made him just and right, 
+Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. 
+Such I created all the ethereal Powers 
+And Spirits, both them who stood, and them who fail'd; 
+Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. 
+Not free, what proof could they have given sincere 
+Of true allegiance, constant faith or love, 
+Where only what they needs must do appear'd, 
+Not what they would?  what praise could they receive? 
+What pleasure I from such obedience paid, 
+When will and reason (reason also is choice) 
+Useless and vain, of freedom both despoil'd, 
+Made passive both, had serv'd necessity, 
+Not me?  they therefore, as to right belong$ 'd, 
+So were created, nor can justly accuse 
+Their Maker, or their making, or their fate, 
+As if predestination over-rul'd 
+Their will dispos'd by absolute decree 
+Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed 
+Their own revolt, not I; if I foreknew, 
+Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, 
+Which had no less proved certain unforeknown. 
+So without least impulse or shadow of fate, 
+Or aught by me immutably foreseen, 
+They trespass, authors to themselves in all 
+Both what they judge, and what they choose; for so 
+I form'd them free: and free they must remain, 
+Till they enthrall themselves; I else must change 
+Their nature, and revoke the high decree 
+Unchangeable, eternal, which ordain'd 
+$THeir freedom: they themselves ordain'd their fall. 
+The first sort by their own suggestion fell, 
+Self-tempted, self-deprav'd:  Man falls, deceiv'd 
+By the other first:  Man therefore shall find grace, 
+The other none:  In mercy and justice both, 
+Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel; 
+But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine. 
+Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd 
+All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect 
+Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd. 
+Beyond compare the Son of God was seen 
+Most glorious; in him all his Father shone 
+Substantially express'd; and in his face 
+Divine compassion visibly appear'd, 
+Love without end, and without measure grace, 
+Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake. 
+O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd 
+Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace; 
+, that Man should find grace; 
+For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol 
+Thy praises, with the innumerable sound 
+Of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne 
+Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest. 
+For should Man finally be lost, should Man, 
+Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest son, 
+Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd 
+With his own folly?  that be from thee far, 
+That far be from thee, Father, who art judge 
+Of all things made, and judgest only right. 
+Or shall the Adversary thus obtain 
+His end, and frustrate thine?  shall he fulfill 
+His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought, 
+Or proud return, though to his heavier doom, 
+Yet with revenge accomplish'd, and to Hell 
+Draw after him the whole race of mankind, 
+By him corrupted?  or wilt thou thyself 
+Abolish thy creation, and unmake 
+For him, what for thy glory thou hast made? 
+So should thy goodness and thy greatness both 
+Be question'd and blasphem'd without defence. 
+To whom the great Creator thus replied. 
+O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight, 
+Son of my bosom, Son who art alone. 
+My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,  
+All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all 
+As my eternal purpose hath decreed; 
+Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will; 
+Yet not of will in him, but grace in me 
+Freely vouchsaf'd; once more I will renew 
+His lapsed powers, though forfeit; and enthrall'd 
+By sin to foul exorbitant desires; 
+Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand 
+On even ground against his mortal foe; 
+By me upheld, that he may know how frail 
+His fallen condition is, and to me owe 
+All his deliverance, and to none but me. 
+Some I have chosen of peculiar grace, 
+Elect above the rest; so is my will: 
+The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn'd 
+Their sinful state, and to appease betimes 
+The incensed Deity, while offer'd grace 
+Invites; for I will clear their senses dark, 
+What may suffice, and soften stony hearts 
+To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. 
+To prayer, repentance, and obedience due, 
+Though but endeavour'd with sincere intent, 
+Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. 
+And I will place within them as a guide, 
+My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear, 
+Light after light, well us'd, they shall attain, 
+And to the end, persisting, safe arrive. 
+This my long sufferance, and my day of grace, 
+They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; 
+But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more, 
+That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; 
+And none but such from mercy I exclude. 
+But yet all is not done; Man disobeying, 
+Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins 
+Against the high supremacy of Heaven, 
+Affecting God-head, and, so losing all, 
+To expiate his treason hath nought left, 
+But to destruction sacred and devote, 
+He, with his whole posterity, must die, 
+Die he or justice must; unless for him 
+Some other able, and as willing, pay 
+The rigid satisfaction, death for death. 
+Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love? 
+Which of you will be mortal, to redeem 
+Man's mortal crime, and just the unjust to save? 
+Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear? 
+And silence was in Heaven: $ on Man's behalf 
+He ask'd, but all the heavenly quire stood mute, 
+Patron or intercessour none appear'd, 
+Much less that durst upon his own head draw 
+The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. 
+And now without redemption all mankind 
+Must have been lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell 
+By doom severe, had not the Son of God, 
+In whom the fulness dwells of love divine, 
+His dearest mediation thus renew'd. 
+Father, thy word is past, Man shall find grace; 
+And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, 
+The speediest of thy winged messengers, 
+To visit all thy creatures, and to all 
+Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought? 
+Happy for Man, so coming; he her aid 
+Can never seek, once dead in sins, and lost; 
+Atonement for himself, or offering meet, 
+Indebted and undone, hath none to bring; 
+Behold me then:  me for him, life for life 
+I offer: on me let thine anger fall; 
+Account me Man; I for his sake will leave 
+ Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee 
+ Freely put off, and for him lastly die 
+ Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage. 
+ Under his gloomy power I shall not long 
+ Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to possess 
+ Life in myself for ever; by thee I live; 
+ Though now to Death I yield, and am his due, 
+ All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid, 
+ $ thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave 
+ His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul 
+ For ever with corruption there to dwell; 
+ But I shall rise victorious, and subdue 
+ My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil. 
+ Death his death's wound shall then receive, and stoop 
+ Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed; 
+ I through the ample air in triumph high 
+ Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show 
+The powers of darkness bound. Thou, at the sight 
+ Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, 
+ While, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes; 
+ Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave; 
+ Then, with the multitude of my redeemed, 
+ Shall enter Heaven, long absent, and return, 
+ Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud 
+ Of anger shall remain, but peace assured 
+ And reconcilement: wrath shall be no more 
+ Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. 
+ His words here ended; but his meek aspect 
+ Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love 
+ To mortal men, above which only shone 
+ Filial obedience: as a sacrifice 
+ Glad to be offered, he attends the will 
+ Of his great Father. Admiration seized 
+ All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend, 
+ Wondering; but soon th' Almighty thus replied. 
+ O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace 
+ Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou 
+ My sole complacence! Well thou know'st how dear 
+ To me are all my works; nor Man the least, 
+ Though last created, that for him I spare 
+ Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, 
+ By losing thee a while, the whole race lost.                    
+ 
+     00021053  
+ Thou, therefore, whom thou only canst redeem, 
+ Their nature also to thy nature join; 
+ And be thyself Man among men on Earth, 
+ Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed, 
+ By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam's room 
+The head of all mankind, though Adam's son. 
+As in him perish all men, so in thee, 
+As from a second root, shall be restored 
+As many as are restored, without thee none. 
+His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit, 
+Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce 
+Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, 
+And live in thee transplanted, and from thee 
+Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just, 
+Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die, 
+And dying rise, and rising with him raise 
+His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life. 
+So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate, 
+Giving to death, and dying to redeem, 
+So dearly to redeem what hellish hate 
+So easily destroyed, and still destroys 
+In those who, when they may, accept not grace. 
+Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume 
+Man's nature, lessen or degrade thine own. 
+Because thou hast, though throned in highest bliss 
+Equal to God, and equally enjoying 
+God-like fruition, quitted all, to save 
+A world from utter loss, and hast been found 
+By merit more than birthright Son of God, 
+Found worthiest to be so by being good, 
+Far more than great or high; because in thee 
+Love hath abounded more than glory abounds; 
+Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt 
+With thee thy manhood also to this throne: 
+Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign 
+Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, 
+Anointed universal King; all power 
+I give thee; reign for ever, and assume 
+Thy merits; under thee, as head supreme, 
+Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce: 
+All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide 
+In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell. 
+When thou, attended gloriously from Heaven, 
+Shalt in the sky appear, and from thee send 
+The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim 
+Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from all winds, 
+The living, and forthwith the cited dead 
+Of all past ages, to the general doom 
+Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep. 
+Then, all thy saints assembled, thou shalt judge 
+Bad Men and Angels; they, arraigned, shall sink 
+Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full, 
+Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while 
+The world shall burn, and from her ashes spring 
+New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell, 
+And, after all their tribulations long, 
+See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, 
+With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth. 
+Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by, 
+For regal scepter then no more shall need, 
+God shall be all in all.  But, all ye Gods, 
+Adore him, who to compass all this dies; 
+Adore the Son, and honour him as me. 
+No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all 
+The multitude of Angels, with a shout 
+Loud as from numbers without number, sweet 
+As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung 
+With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled 
+The eternal regions:  Lowly reverent 
+Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground 
+With solemn adoration down they cast 
+Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold; 
+Immortal amarant, a flower which once 
+In Paradise, fast by the tree of life, 
+Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence 
+To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows, 
+And flowers aloft shading the fount of life, 
+And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven 
+Rolls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream; 
+With these that never fade the Spirits elect 
+Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams; 
+Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright 
+Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone, 
+Impurpled with celestial roses smiled. 
+Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took, 
+Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side 
+Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet 
+Of charming symphony they introduce 
+Their sacred song, and waken raptures high; 
+No voice exempt, no voice but well could join 
+Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven. 
+Thee, Father, first they sung Omnipotent, 
+Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, 
+Eternal King; the Author of all being, 
+Fonntain of light, thyself invisible 
+Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st 
+Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest 
+The full blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud 
+Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine, 
+Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear, 
+Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim 
+Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes. 
+Thee next they sang of all creation first, 
+Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, 
+In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud 
+Made visible, the Almighty Father shines, 
+Whom else no creature can behold; on thee 
+Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides, 
+Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests. 
+He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein 
+By thee created; and by thee threw down 
+The aspiring Dominations:  Thou that day 
+Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare, 
+Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook 
+Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks 
+Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed. 
+Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim 
+Thee only extolled, Son of thy Father's might, 
+To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, 
+Not so on Man:  Him through their malice fallen, 
+Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom 
+So strictly, but much more to pity incline: 
+No sooner did thy dear and only Son 
+Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man 
+So strictly, but much more to pity inclined, 
+He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife 
+Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned, 
+Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat 
+Second to thee, offered himself to die 
+For Man's offence.  O unexampled love, 
+Love no where to be found less than Divine! 
+Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men!  Thy name 
+Shall be the copious matter of my song 
+Henceforth, and never shall my heart thy praise 
+Forget, nor from thy Father's praise disjoin. 
+Thus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere, 
+Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent. 
+Mean while upon the firm opacous globe 
+Of this round world, whose first convex divides 
+The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed 
+From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkness old, 
+Satan alighted walks:  A globe far off 
+It seemed, now seems a boundless continent 
+Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night 
+Starless exposed, and ever-threatening storms 
+Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky; 
+Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven, 
+Though distant far, some small reflection gains 
+Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud: 
+Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field. 
+As when a vultur on Imaus bred, 
+Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds, 
+Dislodging from a region scarce of prey 
+To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids, 
+On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs 
+Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; 
+But in his way lights on the barren plains 
+Of Sericana, where Chineses drive 
+With sails and wind their cany waggons light: 
+So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend 
+Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey; 
+Alone, for other creature in this place, 
+Living or lifeless, to be found was none; 
+None yet, but store hereafter from the earth 
+Up hither like aereal vapours flew 
+Of all things transitory and vain, when sin 
+With vanity had filled the works of men: 
+Both all things vain, and all who in vain things 
+Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame, 
+Or happiness in this or the other life; 
+All who have their reward on earth, the fruits 
+Of painful superstition and blind zeal, 
+Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find 
+Fit retribution, empty as their deeds; 
+All the unaccomplished works of Nature's hand, 
+Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed, 
+Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, 
+Till final dissolution, wander here; 
+Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed; 
+Those argent fields more likely habitants, 
+Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold 
+Betwixt the angelical and human kind. 
+Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born 
+First from the ancient world those giants came 
+With many a vain exploit, though then renowned: 
+The builders next of Babel on the plain 
+Of Sennaar, and still with vain design, 
+New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build: 
+Others came single; he, who, to be deemed 
+A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames, 
+Empedocles; and he, who, to enjoy 
+Plato's Elysium, leaped into the sea, 
+Cleombrotus; and many more too long, 
+Embryos, and idiots, eremites, and friars 
+White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery. 
+Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek 
+In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven; 
+And they, who to be sure of Paradise, 
+Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick, 
+Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised; 
+They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed, 
+And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs 
+The trepidation talked, and that first moved; 
+And now Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket seems 
+To wait them with his keys, and now at foot 
+Of Heaven's ascent they lift their feet, when lo 
+A violent cross wind from either coast 
+Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry 
+Into the devious air:  Then might ye see 
+Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost 
+And fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads, 
+Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls, 
+The sport of winds:  All these, upwhirled aloft, 
+Fly o'er the backside of the world far off 
+Into a Limbo large and broad, since called 
+The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown 
+Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod. 
+All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed, 
+And long he wandered, till at last a gleam 
+Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste 
+His travelled steps: far distant he descries 
+Ascending by degrees magnificent 
+Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high; 
+At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared 
+The work as of a kingly palace-gate, 
+With frontispiece of diamond and gold 
+Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems 
+The portal shone, inimitable on earth 
+By model, or by shading pencil, drawn. 
+These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw 
+Angels ascending and descending, bands 
+Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled 
+To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz 
+Dreaming by night under the open sky 
+And waking cried,  This is the gate of Heaven. 
+Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood 
+There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes 
+Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed 
+Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon 
+Who after came from earth, failing arrived 
+Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the lake 
+Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds. 
+The stairs were then let down, whether to dare 
+The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate 
+His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss: 
+Direct against which opened from beneath, 
+Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise, 
+A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide, 
+Wider by far than that of after-times 
+Over mount Sion, and, though that were large, 
+Over the Promised Land to God so dear; 
+By which, to visit oft those happy tribes, 
+On high behests his angels to and fro 
+Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard 
+From Paneas, the fount of Jordan's flood, 
+To Beersaba, where the Holy Land 
+Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore; 
+So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set 
+To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave. 
+Satan from hence, now on the lower stair, 
+That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate, 
+Looks down with wonder at the sudden view 
+Of all this world at once.  As when a scout, 
+Through dark?;nd desart ways with?oeril gone 
+All?might,?;t?kast by break of cheerful dawn 
+Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill, 
+Which to his eye discovers unaware 
+The goodly prospect of some foreign land 
+First seen, or some renowned metropolis 
+With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned, 
+Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams: 
+Such wonder seised, though after Heaven seen, 
+The Spirit malign, but much more envy seised, 
+At sight of all this world beheld so fair. 
+Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood 
+So high above the circling canopy 
+Of night's extended shade,) from eastern point 
+Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears 
+Andromeda far off Atlantick seas 
+Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole 
+He views in breadth, and without longer pause 
+Down right into the world's first region throws 
+His flight precipitant, and winds with ease 
+Through the pure marble air his oblique way 
+Amongst innumerable stars, that shone 
+Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds; 
+Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles, 
+Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old, 
+Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales, 
+Thrice happy isles; but who dwelt happy there 
+He staid not to inquire:  Above them all 
+The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven, 
+Allured his eye; thither his course he bends 
+Through the calm firmament, (but up or down, 
+By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell, 
+Or longitude,) where the great luminary 
+Aloof the vulgar constellations thick, 
+That from his lordly eye keep distance due, 
+Dispenses light from far; they, as they move 
+Their starry dance in numbers that compute 
+Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp 
+Turn swift their various motions, or are turned 
+By his magnetick beam, that gently warms 
+The universe, and to each inward part 
+With gentle penetration, though unseen, 
+Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep; 
+So wonderously was set his station bright. 
+There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps 
+Astronomer in the sun's lucent orb 
+Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw. 
+The place he found beyond expression bright, 
+Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone; 
+Not all parts like, but all alike informed 
+With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire; 
+If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear; 
+If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite, 
+Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone 
+In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides 
+Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen, 
+That stone, or like to that which here below 
+Philosophers in vain so long have sought, 
+In vain, though by their powerful art they bind 
+Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound 
+In various shapes old Proteus from the sea, 
+Drained through a limbeck to his native form. 
+What wonder then if fields and regions here 
+Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run 
+Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch 
+The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote, 
+Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed, 
+Here in the dark so many precious things 
+Of colour glorious, and effect so rare? 
+Here matter new to gaze the Devil met 
+Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands; 
+For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, 
+But all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon 
+Culminate from the equator, as they now 
+Shot upward still direct, whence no way round 
+Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air, 
+No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray 
+To objects distant far, whereby he soon 
+Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand, 
+The same whom John saw also in the sun: 
+His back was turned, but not his brightness hid; 
+Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar 
+Circled his head, nor less his locks behind 
+Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings 
+Lay waving round; on some great charge employed 
+He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep. 
+Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope 
+To find who might direct his wandering flight 
+To Paradise, the happy seat of Man, 
+His journey's end and our beginning woe. 
+But first he casts to change his proper shape, 
+Which else might work him danger or delay: 
+And now a stripling Cherub he appears, 
+Not of the prime, yet such as in his face 
+Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb 
+Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned: 
+Under a coronet his flowing hair 
+In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore 
+Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold; 
+His habit fit for speed succinct, and held 
+Before his decent steps a silver wand. 
+He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright, 
+Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned, 
+Admonished by his ear, and straight was known 
+The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven 
+Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne, 
+Stand ready at command, and are his eyes 
+That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth 
+Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, 
+O'er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts. 
+Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand 
+In sight of God's high throne, gloriously bright, 
+The first art wont his great authentick will 
+Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring, 
+Where all his sons thy embassy attend; 
+And here art likeliest by supreme decree 
+Like honour to obtain, and as his eye 
+To visit oft this new creation round; 
+Unspeakable desire to see, and know 
+All these his wonderous works, but chiefly Man, 
+His chief delight and favour, him for whom 
+All these his works so wonderous he ordained, 
+Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim 
+Alone thus wandering.  Brightest Seraph, tell 
+In which of all these shining orbs hath Man 
+His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, 
+But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell; 
+That I may find him, and with secret gaze 
+Or open admiration him behold, 
+On whom the great Creator hath bestowed 
+Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured; 
+That both in him and all things, as is meet, 
+The universal Maker we may praise; 
+Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes 
+To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss, 
+Created this new happy race of Men 
+To serve him better:  Wise are all his ways. 
+So spake the false dissembler unperceived; 
+For neither Man nor Angel can discern 
+Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks 
+Invisible, except to God alone, 
+By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth: 
+And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps 
+At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity 
+Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill 
+Where no ill seems:  Which now for once beguiled 
+Uriel, though regent of the sun, and held 
+The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven; 
+Who to the fraudulent impostor foul, 
+In his uprightness, answer thus returned. 
+Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know 
+The works of God, thereby to glorify 
+The great Work-master, leads to no excess 
+That reaches blame, but rather merits praise 
+The more it seems excess, that led thee hither 
+From thy empyreal mansion thus alone, 
+To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps, 
+Contented with report, hear only in Heaven: 
+For wonderful indeed are all his works, 
+Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all 
+Had in remembrance always with delight; 
+But what created mind can comprehend 
+Their number, or the wisdom infinite 
+That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep? 
+I saw when at his word the formless mass, 
+This world's material mould, came to a heap: 
+Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar 
+Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined; 
+Till at his second bidding Darkness fled, 
+Light shone, and order from disorder sprung: 
+Swift to their several quarters hasted then 
+The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire; 
+And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven 
+Flew upward, spirited with various forms, 
+That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars 
+Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; 
+Each had his place appointed, each his course; 
+The rest in circuit walls this universe. 
+Look downward on that globe, whose hither side 
+With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; 
+That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light 
+His day, which else, as the other hemisphere, 
+Night would invade; but there the neighbouring moon 
+So call that opposite fair star) her aid 
+Timely interposes, and her monthly round 
+Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven, 
+With borrowed light her countenance triform 
+Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth, 
+And in her pale dominion checks the night. 
+That spot, to which I point, is Paradise, 
+Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower. 
+Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. 
+Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low, 
+As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven, 
+Where honour due and reverence none neglects, 
+Took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath, 
+Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success, 
+Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel; 
+Nor staid, till on Niphates' top he lights. 
+ 
+

+ 
+ 
+O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw 
+The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud, 
+Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, 
+Came furious down to be revenged on men, 
+Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now, 
+While time was, our first parents had been warned 
+The coming of their secret foe, and 'scaped, 
+Haply so 'scaped his mortal snare:  For now 
+Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down, 
+The tempter ere the accuser of mankind, 
+To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss 
+Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell: 
+Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though bold 
+Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, 
+Begins his dire attempt; which nigh the birth 
+Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast, 
+And like a devilish engine back recoils 
+Upon himself; horrour and doubt distract 
+His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir 
+The Hell within him; for within him Hell 
+He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell 
+One step, no more than from himself, can fly 
+By change of place:  Now conscience wakes despair, 
+That slumbered; wakes the bitter memory 
+Of what he was, what is, and what must be 
+Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. 
+Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view 
+Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad; 
+Sometimes towards Heaven, and the full-blazing sun, 
+Which now sat high in his meridian tower: 
+Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began. 
+O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned, 
+Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God 
+Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars 
+Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call, 
+But with no friendly voice, and add thy name, 
+Of Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams, 
+That bring to my remembrance from what state 
+I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere; 
+Till pride and worse ambition threw me down 
+Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King: 
+Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return 
+From me, whom he created what I was 
+In that bright eminence, and with his good 
+Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. 
+What could be less than to afford him praise, 
+The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, 
+How due! yet all his good proved ill in me, 
+And wrought but malice; lifted up so high 
+I sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher 
+Would set me highest, and in a moment quit 
+The debt immense of endless gratitude, 
+So burdensome still paying, still to owe, 
+Forgetful what from him I still received, 
+And understood not that a grateful mind 
+By owing owes not, but still pays, at once 
+Indebted and discharged; what burden then 
+O, had his powerful destiny ordained 
+Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood 
+Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised 
+Ambition!  Yet why not some other Power 
+As great might have aspired, and me, though mean, 
+Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great 
+Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within 
+Or from without, to all temptations armed. 
+Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand? 
+Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, 
+But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all? 
+Be then his love accursed, since love or hate, 
+To me alike, it deals eternal woe. 
+Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will 
+Chose freely what it now so justly rues. 
+Me miserable! which way shall I fly 
+Infinite wrath, and infinite despair? 
+Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell; 
+And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep 
+Still threatening to devour me opens wide, 
+To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven. 
+O, then, at last relent:  Is there no place 
+Left for repentance, none for pardon left? 
+None left but by submission; and that word 
+Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame 
+Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced 
+With other promises and other vaunts 
+Than to submit, boasting I could subdue 
+The Omnipotent.  Ay me! they little know 
+How dearly I abide that boast so vain, 
+Under what torments inwardly I groan, 
+While they adore me on the throne of Hell. 
+With diadem and scepter high advanced, 
+The lower still I fall, only supreme 
+In misery:  Such joy ambition finds. 
+But say I could repent, and could obtain, 
+By act of grace, my former state; how soon 
+Would highth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay 
+What feigned submission swore?  Ease would recant 
+Vows made in pain, as violent and void. 
+For never can true reconcilement grow, 
+Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep: 
+Which would but lead me to a worse relapse 
+And heavier fall:  so should I purchase dear 
+Short intermission bought with double smart. 
+This knows my Punisher; therefore as far 
+From granting he, as I from begging, peace; 
+All hope excluded thus, behold, in stead 
+Mankind created, and for him this world. 
+So farewell, hope; and with hope farewell, fear; 
+Farewell, remorse! all good to me is lost; 
+Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least 
+Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold, 
+By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign; 
+As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know. 
+Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face 
+Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair; 
+Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed 
+Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld. 
+For heavenly minds from such distempers foul 
+Are ever clear.  Whereof he soon aware, 
+Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm, 
+Artificer of fraud; and was the first 
+That practised falsehood under saintly show, 
+Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge: 
+Yet not enough had practised to deceive 
+Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down 
+ The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount 
+ Saw him disfigured, more than could befall 
+ Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce 
+ He marked and mad demeanour, then alone, 
+ As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen. 
+ So on he fares, and to the border comes 
+ Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, 
+ Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green, 
+ As with a rural mound, the champaign head 
+ Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides 
+Access denied; and overhead upgrew 
+ Insuperable height of loftiest shade, 
+ Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm, 
+ A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend, 
+ Shade above shade, a woody theatre 
+ Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops 
+ The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung;                        
+ 
+    00081429  
+Which to our general sire gave prospect large 
+Into his nether empire neighbouring round. 
+And higher than that wall a circling row 
+Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit, 
+Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue, 
+Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed: 
+On which the sun more glad impressed his beams 
+Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, 
+When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed 
+That landskip:  And of pure now purer air 
+Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires 
+Vernal delight and joy, able to drive 
+All sadness but despair:  Now gentle gales, 
+Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense 
+Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole 
+Those balmy spoils.  As when to them who fail 
+Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past 
+Mozambick, off at sea north-east winds blow 
+Sabean odours from the spicy shore 
+Of Araby the blest; with such delay 
+Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league 
+Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles: 
+So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend, 
+Who came their bane; though with them better pleased 
+Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume 
+That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse 
+Of Tobit's son, and with a vengeance sent 
+From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound. 
+Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill 
+Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow; 
+But further way found none, so thick entwined, 
+As one continued brake, the undergrowth 
+Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed 
+All path of man or beast that passed that way. 
+One gate there only was, and that looked east 
+On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw, 
+Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt, 
+At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound 
+Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within 
+Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling wolf, 
+Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, 
+Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve 
+In hurdled cotes amid the field secure, 
+Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold: 
+Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash 
+Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors, 
+Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault, 
+In at the window climbs, or o'er the tiles: 
+So clomb this first grand thief into God's fold; 
+So since into his church lewd hirelings climb. 
+Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life, 
+The middle tree and highest there that grew, 
+Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life 
+Thereby regained, but sat devising death 
+To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought 
+Of that life-giving plant, but only used 
+For prospect, what well used had been the pledge 
+Of immortality.  So little knows 
+Any, but God alone, to value right 
+The good before him, but perverts best things 
+To worst abuse, or to their meanest use. 
+Beneath him with new wonder now he views, 
+To all delight of human sense exposed, 
+In narrow room, Nature's whole wealth, yea more, 
+A Heaven on Earth:  For blissful Paradise 
+Of God the garden was, by him in the east 
+Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line 
+From Auran eastward to the royal towers 
+Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings, 
+Of where the sons of Eden long before 
+Dwelt in Telassar:  In this pleasant soil 
+His far more pleasant garden God ordained; 
+Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow 
+All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; 
+And all amid them stood the tree of life, 
+High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit 
+Of vegetable gold; and next to life, 
+Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by, 
+Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill. 
+Southward through Eden went a river large, 
+Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill 
+Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown 
+That mountain as his garden-mould high raised 
+Upon the rapid current, which, through veins 
+Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn, 
+Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill 
+Watered the garden; thence united fell 
+Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood, 
+Which from his darksome passage now appears, 
+And now, divided into four main streams, 
+Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm 
+And country, whereof here needs no account; 
+But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, 
+How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks, 
+Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold, 
+With mazy errour under pendant shades 
+Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed 
+Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art 
+In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon 
+Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain, 
+Both where the morning sun first warmly smote 
+The open field, and where the unpierced shade 
+Imbrowned the noontide bowers:  Thus was this place 
+A happy rural seat of various view; 
+Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm, 
+Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind, 
+Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true, 
+If true, here only, and of delicious taste: 
+Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks 
+Grazing the tender herb, were interposed, 
+Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap 
+Of some irriguous valley spread her store, 
+Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose: 
+Another side, umbrageous grots and caves 
+Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine 
+Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps 
+Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall 
+Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake, 
+That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned 
+Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams. 
+The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs, 
+Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune 
+The trembling leaves, while universal Pan, 
+Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance, 
+Led on the eternal Spring.  Not that fair field 
+Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers, 
+Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis 
+Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain 
+To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove 
+Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired 
+Castalian spring, might with this Paradise 
+Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle 
+Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham, 
+Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove, 
+Hid Amalthea, and her florid son 
+Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye; 
+Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard, 
+Mount Amara, though this by some supposed 
+True Paradise under the Ethiop line 
+By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock, 
+A whole day's journey high, but wide remote 
+From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend 
+Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind 
+Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange 
+Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall, 
+Godlike erect, with native honour clad 
+In naked majesty seemed lords of all: 
+And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine 
+The image of their glorious Maker shone, 
+Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure, 
+(Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,) 
+Whence true authority in men; though both 
+Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed; 
+For contemplation he and valour formed; 
+For softness she and sweet attractive grace; 
+He for God only, she for God in him: 
+His fair large front and eye sublime declared 
+Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks 
+Round from his parted forelock manly hung 
+Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad: 
+She, as a veil, down to the slender waist 
+Her unadorned golden tresses wore 
+Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved 
+As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied 
+Subjection, but required with gentle sway, 
+And by her yielded, by him best received, 
+Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, 
+And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay. 
+Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed; 
+Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame 
+Of nature's works, honour dishonourable, 
+Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind 
+With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure, 
+And banished from man's life his happiest life, 
+Simplicity and spotless innocence! 
+So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight 
+Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill: 
+So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair, 
+That ever since in love's embraces met; 
+Adam the goodliest man of men since born 
+His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve. 
+Under a tuft of shade that on a green 
+Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side 
+They sat them down; and, after no more toil 
+Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed 
+To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease 
+More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite 
+More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell, 
+Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs 
+Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline 
+On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers: 
+The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind, 
+Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream; 
+Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles 
+Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems 
+Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league, 
+Alone as they.  About them frisking played 
+All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase 
+In wood or wilderness, forest or den; 
+Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw 
+Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards, 
+Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant, 
+To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed 
+His?kithetmroboscis; close the serpent sly, 
+Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine 
+His braided train, and of his fatal guile 
+Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass 
+Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat, 
+Or bedward ruminating; for the sun, 
+Declined, was hasting now with prone career 
+To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale 
+Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose: 
+When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, 
+Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad. 
+O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold! 
+Into our room of bliss thus high advanced 
+Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, 
+Not Spirits, yet to heavenly Spirits bright 
+Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue 
+With wonder, and could love, so lively shines 
+In them divine resemblance, and such grace 
+The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured. 
+Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh 
+Your change approaches, when all these delights 
+Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe; 
+More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; 
+Happy, but for so happy ill secured 
+Long to continue, and this high seat your Heaven 
+Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe 
+As now is entered; yet no purposed foe 
+To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn, 
+Though I unpitied:  League with you I seek, 
+And mutual amity, so strait, so close, 
+That I with you must dwell, or you with me 
+Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please, 
+Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such 
+Accept your Maker's work; he gave it me, 
+Which I as freely give:  Hell shall unfold, 
+To entertain you two, her widest gates, 
+And send forth all her kings; there will be room, 
+Not like these narrow limits, to receive 
+Your numerous offspring; if no better place, 
+Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge 
+On you who wrong me not for him who wronged. 
+And should I at your harmless innocence 
+Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just, 
+Honour and empire with revenge enlarged, 
+By conquering this new world, compels me now 
+To do what else, though damned, I should abhor. 
+So spake the Fiend, and with necessity, 
+The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds. 
+Then from his lofty stand on that high tree 
+Down he alights among the sportful herd 
+Of those four-footed kinds, himself now one, 
+Now other, as their shape served best his end 
+Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied, 
+To mark what of their state he more might learn, 
+By word or action marked. About them round 
+A lion now he stalks with fiery glare; 
+Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied 
+In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play, 
+Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft 
+His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground, 
+Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both, 
+Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men 
+To first of women Eve thus moving speech, 
+Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow. 
+Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys, 
+Dearer thyself than all; needs must the Power 
+That made us, and for us this ample world, 
+Be infinitely good, and of his good 
+As liberal and free as infinite; 
+That raised us from the dust, and placed us here 
+In all this happiness, who at his hand 
+Have nothing merited, nor can perform 
+Aught whereof he hath need; he who requires 
+From us no other service than to keep 
+This one, this easy charge, of all the trees 
+In Paradise that bear delicious fruit 
+So various, not to taste that only tree 
+Of knowledge, planted by the tree of life; 
+So near grows death to life, whate'er death is, 
+Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowest 
+God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree, 
+The only sign of our obedience left, 
+Among so many signs of power and rule 
+Conferred upon us, and dominion given 
+Over all other creatures that possess 
+Earth, air, and sea.  Then let us not think hard 
+One easy prohibition, who enjoy 
+Free leave so large to all things else, and choice 
+Unlimited of manifold delights: 
+But let us ever praise him, and extol 
+His bounty, following our delightful task, 
+To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers, 
+Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet. 
+To whom thus Eve replied.  O thou for whom 
+And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh, 
+And without whom am to no end, my guide 
+And head! what thou hast said is just and right. 
+For we to him indeed all praises owe, 
+And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy 
+So far the happier lot, enjoying thee 
+Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou 
+Like consort to thyself canst no where find. 
+That day I oft remember, when from sleep 
+I first awaked, and found myself reposed 
+Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where 
+And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. 
+Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound 
+Of waters issued from a cave, and spread 
+Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved 
+Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went 
+With unexperienced thought, and laid me down 
+On the green bank, to look into the clear 
+Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky. 
+As I bent down to look, just opposite 
+A shape within the watery gleam appeared, 
+Bending to look on me:  I started back, 
+It started back; but pleased I soon returned, 
+Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks 
+Of sympathy and love:  There I had fixed 
+Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire, 
+Had not a voice thus warned me;  'What thou seest, 
+'What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself; 
+'With thee it came and goes: but follow me, 
+'And I will bring thee where no shadow stays 
+'Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he 
+'Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy 
+'Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear 
+'Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called 
+'Mother of human race.'  What could I do, 
+But follow straight, invisibly thus led? 
+Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall, 
+Under a platane; yet methought less fair, 
+Less winning soft, less amiably mild, 
+Than that smooth watery image:  Back I turned; 
+Thou following cryedst aloud, 'Return, fair Eve; 
+'Whom flyest thou?  whom thou flyest, of him thou art, 
+'His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent 
+'Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart, 
+'Substantial life, to have thee by my side 
+'Henceforth an individual solace dear; 
+'Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim 
+'My other half:'  With that thy gentle hand 
+Seised mine:  I yielded;and from that time see 
+How beauty is excelled by manly grace, 
+And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. 
+So spake our general mother, and with eyes 
+Of conjugal attraction unreproved, 
+And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned 
+On our first father; half her swelling breast 
+Naked met his, under the flowing gold 
+Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight 
+Both of her beauty, and submissive charms, 
+Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter 
+On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds 
+That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip 
+With kisses pure:  Aside the Devil turned 
+For envy; yet with jealous leer malign 
+Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained. 
+Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two, 
+Imparadised in one another's arms, 
+The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill 
+Of bliss on bliss; while I to Hell am thrust, 
+Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, 
+Among our other torments not the least, 
+Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines. 
+Yet let me not forget what I have gained 
+From their own mouths:  All is not theirs, it seems; 
+One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called, 
+Forbidden them to taste:  Knowledge forbidden 
+Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should their Lord 
+Envy them that?  Can it be sin to know? 
+Can it be death?  And do they only stand 
+By ignorance?  Is that their happy state, 
+The proof of their obedience and their faith? 
+O fair foundation laid whereon to build 
+Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds 
+With more desire to know, and to reject 
+Envious commands, invented with design 
+To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt 
+Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such, 
+They taste and die:  What likelier can ensue 
+But first with narrow search I must walk round 
+This garden, and no corner leave unspied; 
+A chance but chance may lead where I may meet 
+Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side, 
+Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw 
+What further would be learned.  Live while ye may, 
+Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return, 
+Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed! 
+So saying, his proud step he scornful turned, 
+But with sly circumspection, and began 
+Through wood, through waste, o'er hill, o'er dale, his roam 
+Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven 
+With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun 
+Slowly descended, and with right aspect 
+Against the eastern gate of Paradise 
+Levelled his evening rays:  It was a rock 
+Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds, 
+Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent 
+Accessible from earth, one entrance high; 
+The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung 
+Still as it rose, impossible to climb. 
+Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat, 
+Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night; 
+About him exercised heroick games 
+The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand 
+Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears, 
+Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold. 
+Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even 
+On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star 
+In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired 
+Impress the air, and shows the mariner 
+From what point of his compass to beware 
+Impetuous winds:  He thus began in haste. 
+Gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath given 
+Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place 
+No evil thing approach or enter in. 
+This day at highth of noon came to my sphere 
+A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know 
+More of the Almighty's works, and chiefly Man, 
+God's latest image:  I described his way 
+Bent all on speed, and marked his aery gait; 
+But in the mount that lies from Eden north, 
+Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks 
+Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured: 
+Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade 
+Lost sight of him:  One of the banished crew, 
+I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise 
+New troubles; him thy care must be to find. 
+To whom the winged warriour thus returned. 
+Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight, 
+Amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst, 
+See far and wide:  In at this gate none pass 
+The vigilance here placed, but such as come 
+Well known from Heaven; and since meridian hour 
+No creature thence:  If Spirit of other sort, 
+So minded, have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds 
+On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude 
+Spiritual substance with corporeal bar. 
+But if within the circuit of these walks, 
+In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom 
+Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know. 
+So promised he; and Uriel to his charge 
+Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised 
+Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen 
+Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb, 
+Incredible how swift, had thither rolled 
+Diurnal, or this less volubil earth, 
+By shorter flight to the east, had left him there 
+Arraying with reflected purple and gold 
+The clouds that on his western throne attend. 
+Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray 
+Had in her sober livery all things clad; 
+Silence accompanied; for beast and bird, 
+They to their grassy couch, these to their nests 
+Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale; 
+She all night long her amorous descant sung; 
+Silence was pleased:  Now glowed the firmament 
+With living sapphires:  Hesperus, that led 
+The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon, 
+Rising in clouded majesty, at length 
+Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light, 
+And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw. 
+When Adam thus to Eve.  Fair Consort, the hour 
+Of night, and all things now retired to rest, 
+Mind us of like repose; since God hath set 
+Labour and rest, as day and night, to men 
+Successive; and the timely dew of sleep, 
+Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines 
+Our eye-lids:  Other creatures all day long 
+Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest; 
+Man hath his daily work of body or mind 
+Appointed, which declares his dignity, 
+And the regard of Heaven on all his ways; 
+While other animals unactive range, 
+And of their doings God takes no account. 
+To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east 
+With first approach of light, we must be risen, 
+And at our pleasant labour, to reform 
+Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green, 
+Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, 
+That mock our scant manuring, and require 
+More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth: 
+Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums, 
+That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth, 
+Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; 
+Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest. 
+To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned 
+My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst 
+Unargued I obey:  So God ordains; 
+God is thy law, thou mine:  To know no more 
+Is woman's happiest knowledge, and her praise. 
+With thee conversing I forget all time; 
+All seasons, and their change, all please alike. 
+Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet, 
+With charm of earliest birds:  pleasant the sun, 
+When first on this delightful land he spreads 
+His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower, 
+Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth 
+After soft showers; and sweet the coming on 
+Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night, 
+With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon, 
+And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train: 
+But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends 
+With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun 
+On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower, 
+Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers; 
+Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night, 
+With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon, 
+Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet. 
+But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom 
+This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? 
+To whom our general ancestor replied. 
+Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve, 
+These have their course to finish round the earth, 
+By morrow evening, and from land to land 
+In order, though to nations yet unborn, 
+Ministring light prepared, they set and rise; 
+Lest total Darkness should by night regain 
+Her old possession, and extinguish life 
+In Nature and all things; which these soft fires 
+Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat 
+Of various influence foment and warm, 
+Temper or nourish, or in part shed down 
+Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow 
+On earth, made hereby apter to receive 
+Perfection from the sun's more potent ray. 
+These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, 
+Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none, 
+That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise: 
+Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth 
+Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep: 
+All these with ceaseless praise his works behold 
+Both day and night:  How often from the steep 
+Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard 
+Celestial voices to the midnight air, 
+Sole, or responsive each to others note, 
+Singing their great Creator? oft in bands 
+While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk, 
+With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds 
+In full harmonick number joined, their songs 
+Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. 
+Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed 
+On to their blissful bower: it was a place 
+Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed 
+All things to Man's delightful use; the roof 
+Of thickest covert was inwoven shade 
+Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew 
+Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side 
+Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub, 
+Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower, 
+Iris all hues, roses, and jessamin, 
+Reared high their flourished heads between, and wrought 
+Mosaick; underfoot the violet, 
+Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay 
+Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone 
+Of costliest emblem:  Other creature here, 
+Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none, 
+Such was their awe of Man.  In shadier bower 
+More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned, 
+Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph 
+Nor Faunus haunted.  Here, in close recess, 
+With flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs, 
+Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed; 
+And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung, 
+What day the genial Angel to our sire 
+Brought her in naked beauty more adorned, 
+More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods 
+Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like 
+In sad event, when to the unwiser son 
+Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared 
+Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged 
+On him who had stole Jove's authentick fire. 
+Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood, 
+Both turned, and under open sky adored 
+The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven, 
+Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe, 
+And starry pole:  Thou also madest the night, 
+Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day, 
+Which we, in our appointed work employed, 
+Have finished, happy in our mutual help 
+And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss 
+Ordained by thee; and this delicious place 
+For us too large, where thy abundance wants 
+Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. 
+But thou hast promised from us two a race 
+To fill the earth, who shall with us extol 
+Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, 
+And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. 
+This said unanimous, and other rites 
+Observing none, but adoration pure 
+Which God likes best, into their inmost bower 
+Handed they went; and, eased the putting off 
+These troublesome disguises which we wear, 
+Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween, 
+Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites 
+Mysterious of connubial love refused: 
+Whatever hypocrites austerely talk 
+Of purity, and place, and innocence, 
+Defaming as impure what God declares 
+Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all. 
+Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain 
+But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man? 
+Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source 
+Of human offspring, sole propriety 
+In Paradise of all things common else! 
+By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men 
+Among the bestial herds to range; by thee 
+Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure, 
+Relations dear, and all the charities 
+Of father, son, and brother, first were known. 
+Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, 
+Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, 
+Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets, 
+Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced, 
+Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used. 
+Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights 
+His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, 
+Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile 
+Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared, 
+Casual fruition; nor in court-amours, 
+Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball, 
+Or serenate, which the starved lover sings 
+To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. 
+These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept, 
+And on their naked limbs the flowery roof 
+Showered roses, which the morn repaired.  Sleep on, 
+Blest pair; and O!yet happiest, if ye seek 
+No happier state, and know to know no more. 
+Now had night measured with her shadowy cone 
+Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault, 
+And from their ivory port the Cherubim, 
+Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed 
+To their night watches in warlike parade; 
+When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. 
+Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south 
+With strictest watch; these other wheel the north; 
+Our circuit meets full west.  As flame they part, 
+Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. 
+From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called 
+That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge. 
+Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed 
+Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook; 
+But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, 
+Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm. 
+This evening from the sun's decline arrived, 
+Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen 
+Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped 
+The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: 
+Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. 
+So saying, on he led his radiant files, 
+Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct 
+In search of whom they sought:  Him there they found 
+Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve, 
+Assaying by his devilish art to reach 
+The organs of her fancy, and with them forge 
+Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams; 
+Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint 
+The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise 
+Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise 
+At least distempered, discontented thoughts, 
+Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires, 
+Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride. 
+Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear 
+Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure 
+Touch of celestial temper, but returns 
+Of force to its own likeness:  Up he starts 
+Discovered and surprised.  As when a spark 
+Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid 
+Fit for the tun some magazine to store 
+Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain, 
+With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air; 
+So started up in his own shape the Fiend. 
+Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed 
+So sudden to behold the grisly king; 
+Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon. 
+Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell 
+Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed, 
+Why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait, 
+Here watching at the head of these that sleep? 
+Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn, 
+Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate 
+For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar: 
+Not to know me argues yourselves unknown, 
+The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know, 
+Why ask ye, and superfluous begin 
+Your message, like to end as much in vain? 
+To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. 
+Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, 
+Or undiminished brightness to be known, 
+As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure; 
+That glory then, when thou no more wast good, 
+Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now 
+Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul. 
+But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account 
+To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep 
+This place inviolable, and these from harm. 
+So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke, 
+Severe in youthful beauty, added grace 
+Invincible:  Abashed the Devil stood, 
+And felt how awful goodness is, and saw 
+Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined 
+His loss; but chiefly to find here observed 
+His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed 
+Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he, 
+Best with the best, the sender, not the sent, 
+Or all at once; more glory will be won, 
+Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said Zephon bold, 
+Will save us trial what the least can do 
+Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. 
+The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage; 
+But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on, 
+Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly 
+He held it vain; awe from above had quelled 
+His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh 
+The western point, where those half-rounding guards 
+Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined, 
+A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief, 
+Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud. 
+O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet 
+Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern 
+Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade; 
+And with them comes a third of regal port, 
+But faded splendour wan; who by his gait 
+And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, 
+Not likely to part hence without contest; 
+Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. 
+He scarce had ended, when those two approached, 
+And brief related whom they brought, where found, 
+How busied, in what form and posture couched. 
+To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. 
+Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed 
+To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge 
+Of others, who approve not to transgress 
+By thy example, but have power and right 
+To question thy bold entrance on this place; 
+Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those 
+Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss! 
+To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. 
+Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise, 
+And such I held thee; but this question asked 
+Puts me in doubt.  Lives there who loves his pain! 
+Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, 
+Though thither doomed!  Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt 
+And boldly venture to whatever place 
+Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change 
+Torment with ease, and soonest recompense 
+Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; 
+To thee no reason, who knowest only good, 
+But evil hast not tried: and wilt object 
+His will who bounds us!  Let him surer bar 
+His iron gates, if he intends our stay 
+In that dark durance:  Thus much what was asked. 
+The rest is true, they found me where they say; 
+But that implies not violence or harm. 
+Thus he in scorn.  The warlike Angel moved, 
+Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied. 
+O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise 
+Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew, 
+And now returns him from his prison 'scaped, 
+Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise 
+Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither 
+Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed; 
+So wise he judges it to fly from pain 
+However, and to 'scape his punishment! 
+So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath, 
+Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight 
+Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, 
+Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain 
+Can equal anger infinite provoked. 
+But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee 
+Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they 
+Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief! 
+The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged 
+To thy deserted host this cause of flight, 
+Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. 
+To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern. 
+Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, 
+Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood 
+Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid 
+The blasting vollied thunder made all speed, 
+And seconded thy else not dreaded spear. 
+But still thy words at random, as before, 
+Argue thy inexperience what behoves 
+From hard assays and ill successes past 
+A faithful leader, not to hazard all 
+Through ways of danger by himself untried: 
+I, therefore, I alone first undertook 
+To wing the desolate abyss, and spy 
+This new created world, whereof in Hell 
+Fame is not silent, here in hope to find 
+Better abode, and my afflicted Powers 
+To settle here on earth, or in mid air; 
+Though for possession put to try once more 
+What thou and thy gay legions dare against; 
+Whose easier business were to serve their Lord 
+High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne, 
+And practised distances to cringe, not fight, 
+To whom the warriour Angel soon replied. 
+To say and straight unsay, pretending first 
+Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy, 
+Argues no leader but a liear traced, 
+Satan, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name, 
+O sacred name of faithfulness profaned! 
+Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? 
+Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head. 
+Was this your discipline and faith engaged, 
+Your military obedience, to dissolve 
+Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme? 
+And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem 
+Patron of liberty, who more than thou 
+Once fawned, and cringed, and servily adored 
+Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope 
+To dispossess him, and thyself to reign? 
+But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant; 
+Fly neither whence thou fledst!  If from this hour 
+Within these hallowed limits thou appear, 
+Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained, 
+And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn 
+The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred. 
+So threatened he; but Satan to no threats 
+Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied. 
+Then when I am thy captive talk of chains, 
+Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then 
+Far heavier load thyself expect to feel 
+From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King 
+Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, 
+Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels 
+In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved. 
+While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright 
+Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns 
+Their phalanx, and began to hem him round 
+With ported spears, as thick as when a field 
+Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends 
+Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind 
+Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands, 
+Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves 
+Prove chaff.  On the other side, Satan, alarmed, 
+Collecting all his might, dilated stood, 
+Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved: 
+His stature reached the sky, and on his crest 
+Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp 
+What seemed both spear and shield:  Now dreadful deeds 
+Might have ensued, nor only Paradise 
+In this commotion, but the starry cope 
+Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements 
+At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn 
+With violence of this conflict, had not soon 
+The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray, 
+Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen 
+Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign, 
+Wherein all things created first he weighed, 
+The pendulous round earth with balanced air 
+In counterpoise, now ponders all events, 
+Battles and realms:  In these he put two weights, 
+The sequel each of parting and of fight: 
+The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam, 
+Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. 
+Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine; 
+Neither our own, but given:  What folly then 
+To boast what arms can do? since thine no more 
+Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now 
+To trample thee as mire:  For proof look up, 
+And read thy lot in yon celestial sign; 
+Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak, 
+If thou resist.  The Fiend looked up, and knew 
+His mounted scale aloft:  Nor more;but fled 
+Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. 
+

+ 
+ 
+Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime 
+Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl, 
+When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep 
+Was aery-light, from pure digestion bred, 
+And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound 
+Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan, 
+Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song 
+Of birds on every bough; so much the more 
+His wonder was to find unwakened Eve 
+With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek, 
+As through unquiet rest:  He, on his side 
+Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love 
+Hung over her enamoured, and beheld 
+Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep, 
+Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice 
+Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, 
+Her hand soft touching, whispered thus.  Awake, 
+My fairest, my espoused, my latest found, 
+Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight! 
+Awake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field 
+Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring 
+Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove, 
+What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed, 
+How nature paints her colours, how the bee 
+Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet. 
+Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye 
+On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake. 
+O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, 
+My glory, my perfection! glad I see 
+Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night 
+(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed, 
+If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee, 
+Works of day past, or morrow's next design, 
+But of offence and trouble, which my mind 
+Knew never till this irksome night:  Methought, 
+Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk 
+With gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said, 
+'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time, 
+'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields 
+'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake 
+'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns 
+'Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light 
+'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain, 
+'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes, 
+'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire? 
+'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment 
+'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.' 
+I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; 
+To find thee I directed then my walk; 
+And on, methought, alone I passed through ways 
+That brought me on a sudden to the tree 
+Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed, 
+Much fairer to my fancy than by day: 
+And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood 
+One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven 
+By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled 
+Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed; 
+And 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged, 
+'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet, 
+'Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised? 
+'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste? 
+'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold 
+'Longer thy offered good; why else set here? 
+This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm 
+He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled 
+At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold: 
+But he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine, 
+'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt, 
+'Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit 
+'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: 
+'And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more 
+'Communicated, more abundant grows, 
+'The author not impaired, but honoured more? 
+'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve! 
+'Partake thou also; happy though thou art, 
+'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be: 
+'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods 
+'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined, 
+'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes 
+'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see 
+'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!' 
+So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, 
+Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part 
+Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell 
+So quickened appetite, that I, methought, 
+Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds 
+With him I flew, and underneath beheld 
+The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide 
+And various:  Wondering at my flight and change 
+To this high exaltation; suddenly 
+My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down, 
+And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked 
+To find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night 
+Related, and thus Adam answered sad. 
+Best image of myself, and dearer half, 
+The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep 
+Affects me equally; nor can I like 
+This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear; 
+Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, 
+Created pure.  But know that in the soul 
+Are many lesser faculties, that serve 
+Reason as chief; among these Fancy next 
+Her office holds; of all external things 
+Which the five watchful senses represent, 
+She forms imaginations, aery shapes, 
+Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames 
+All what we affirm or what deny, and call 
+Our knowledge or opinion; then retires 
+Into her private cell, when nature rests. 
+Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes 
+To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes, 
+Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams; 
+Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. 
+Some such resemblances, methinks, I find 
+Of our last evening's talk, in this thy dream, 
+But with addition strange; yet be not sad. 
+Evil into the mind of God or Man 
+May come and go, so unreproved, and leave 
+No spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope 
+That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream, 
+Waking thou never will consent to do. 
+Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks, 
+That wont to be more cheerful and serene, 
+Than when fair morning first smiles on the world; 
+And let us to our fresh employments rise 
+Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers 
+That open now their choisest bosomed smells, 
+Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store. 
+So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered; 
+But silently a gentle tear let fall 
+From either eye, and wiped them with her hair; 
+Two other precious drops that ready stood, 
+Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell 
+Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse 
+And pious awe, that feared to have offended. 
+So all was cleared, and to the field they haste. 
+But first, from under shady arborous roof 
+Soon as they forth were come to open sight 
+Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen, 
+With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim, 
+Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray, 
+Discovering in wide landskip all the east 
+Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains, 
+Lowly they bowed adoring, and began 
+Their orisons, each morning duly paid 
+In various style; for neither various style 
+Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise 
+Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung 
+Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence 
+Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse, 
+More tuneable than needed lute or harp 
+To add more sweetness; and they thus began. 
+These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, 
+Almighty!  Thine this universal frame, 
+Thus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then! 
+Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens 
+To us invisible, or dimly seen 
+In these thy lowest works; yet these declare 
+Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine. 
+Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light, 
+Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs 
+And choral symphonies, day without night, 
+Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven 
+On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol 
+Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. 
+Fairest of stars, last in the train of night, 
+If better thou belong not to the dawn, 
+Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn 
+With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere, 
+While day arises, that sweet hour of prime. 
+Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul, 
+Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise 
+In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest, 
+And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest. 
+Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest, 
+With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies; 
+And ye five other wandering Fires, that move 
+In mystick dance not without song, resound 
+His praise, who out of darkness called up light. 
+Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth 
+Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run 
+Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix 
+And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change 
+Vary to our great Maker still new praise. 
+Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise 
+From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray, 
+Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold, 
+In honour to the world's great Author rise; 
+Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky, 
+Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers, 
+Rising or falling still advance his praise. 
+His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow, 
+Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines, 
+With every plant, in sign of worship wave. 
+Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow, 
+Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. 
+Join voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds, 
+That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend, 
+Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise. 
+Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk 
+The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; 
+Witness if I be silent, morn or even, 
+To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade, 
+Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise. 
+Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still 
+To give us only good; and if the night 
+Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed, 
+Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark! 
+So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts 
+Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm. 
+On to their morning's rural work they haste, 
+Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row 
+Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far 
+Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check 
+Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine 
+To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines 
+Her marriageable arms, and with him brings 
+Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn 
+His barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld 
+With pity Heaven's high King, and to him called 
+Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned 
+To travel with Tobias, and secured 
+His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid. 
+Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth 
+Satan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf, 
+Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed 
+This night the human pair; how he designs 
+In them at once to ruin all mankind. 
+Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend 
+Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade 
+Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired, 
+To respite his day-labour with repast, 
+Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, 
+As may advise him of his happy state, 
+Happiness in his power left free to will, 
+Left to his own free will, his will though free, 
+Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware 
+He swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal 
+His danger, and from whom; what enemy, 
+Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now 
+The fall of others from like state of bliss; 
+By violence? no, for that shall be withstood; 
+But by deceit and lies:  This let him know, 
+Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend 
+Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned. 
+So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled 
+All justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint 
+After his charge received; but from among 
+Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood 
+Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light, 
+Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires, 
+On each hand parting, to his speed gave way 
+Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate 
+Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide 
+On golden hinges turning, as by work 
+Divine the sovran Architect had framed. 
+From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, 
+Star interposed, however small he sees, 
+Not unconformed to other shining globes, 
+Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned 
+Above all hills.  As when by night the glass 
+Of Galileo, less assured, observes 
+Imagined lands and regions in the moon: 
+Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades 
+Delos or Samos first appearing, kens 
+A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight 
+He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky 
+Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing 
+Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan 
+Winnows the buxom air; till, within soar 
+Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems 
+A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird, 
+When, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's 
+Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies. 
+At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise 
+He lights, and to his proper shape returns 
+A Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade 
+His lineaments divine; the pair that clad 
+Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast 
+With regal ornament; the middle pair 
+Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round 
+Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold 
+And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet 
+Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail, 
+Sky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood, 
+And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled 
+The circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands 
+Of Angels under watch; and to his state, 
+And to his message high, in honour rise; 
+For on some message high they guessed him bound. 
+Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come 
+Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh, 
+And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm; 
+A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here 
+Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will 
+Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet, 
+Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss. 
+Him through the spicy forest onward come 
+Adam discerned, as in the door he sat 
+Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun 
+Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm 
+Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs: 
+And Eve within, due at her hour prepared 
+For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please 
+True appetite, and not disrelish thirst 
+Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream, 
+Berry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called. 
+Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold 
+Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape 
+Comes this way moving; seems another morn 
+Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven 
+To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe 
+This day to be our guest.  But go with speed, 
+And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour 
+Abundance, fit to honour and receive 
+Our heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford 
+Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow 
+From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies 
+Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows 
+More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. 
+To whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould, 
+Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store, 
+All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; 
+Save what by frugal storing firmness gains 
+To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: 
+But I will haste, and from each bough and brake, 
+Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice 
+To entertain our Angel-guest, as he 
+Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth 
+God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven. 
+So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste 
+She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent 
+What choice to choose for delicacy best, 
+What order, so contrived as not to mix 
+Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring 
+Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change; 
+Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk 
+Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields 
+In India East or West, or middle shore 
+In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where 
+Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat 
+Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell, 
+She gathers, tribute large, and on the board 
+Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape 
+She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths 
+From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed 
+She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold 
+Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground 
+With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed. 
+Mean while our primitive great sire, to meet 
+His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train 
+Accompanied than with his own complete 
+Perfections; in himself was all his state, 
+More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits 
+On princes, when their rich retinue long 
+Of horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold, 
+Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape. 
+Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed, 
+Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, 
+As to a superiour nature bowing low, 
+Thus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place 
+None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain; 
+Since, by descending from the thrones above, 
+Those happy places thou hast deigned a while 
+To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us 
+Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess 
+This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower 
+To rest; and what the garden choicest bears 
+To sit and taste, till this meridian heat 
+Be over, and the sun more cool decline. 
+Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild. 
+Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such 
+Created, or such place hast here to dwell, 
+As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven, 
+To visit thee; lead on then where thy bower 
+O'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise, 
+I have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge 
+They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled, 
+With flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve, 
+Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair 
+Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned 
+Of three that in mount Ida naked strove, 
+Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil 
+She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm 
+Altered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail 
+Bestowed, the holy salutation used 
+Long after to blest Mary, second Eve. 
+Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb 
+Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons, 
+Than with these various fruits the trees of God 
+Have heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf 
+Their table was, and mossy seats had round, 
+And on her ample square from side to side 
+All autumn piled, though spring and autumn here 
+Danced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold; 
+No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began 
+Our author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste 
+These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom 
+All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends, 
+To us for food and for delight hath caused 
+The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps 
+To spiritual natures; only this I know, 
+That one celestial Father gives to all. 
+To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives 
+(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part 
+Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found 
+No ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure 
+Intelligential substances require, 
+As doth your rational; and both contain 
+Within them every lower faculty 
+Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, 
+Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, 
+And corporeal to incorporeal turn. 
+For know, whatever was created, needs 
+To be sustained and fed:  Of elements 
+The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, 
+Earth and the sea feed air, the air those fires 
+Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon; 
+Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged 
+Vapours not yet into her substance turned. 
+Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale 
+From her moist continent to higher orbs. 
+The sun that light imparts to all, receives 
+From all his alimental recompence 
+In humid exhalations, and at even 
+Sups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees 
+Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines 
+Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn 
+We brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground 
+Covered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here 
+Varied his bounty so with new delights, 
+As may compare with Heaven; and to taste 
+Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat, 
+And to their viands fell; nor seemingly 
+The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss 
+Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch 
+Of real hunger, and concoctive heat 
+To transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires 
+Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire 
+Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist 
+Can turn, or holds it possible to turn, 
+Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold, 
+As from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve 
+Ministered naked, and their flowing cups 
+With pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence 
+Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, 
+Then had the sons of God excuse to have been 
+Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts 
+Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy 
+Was understood, the injured lover's hell. 
+Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed, 
+Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose 
+In Adam, not to let the occasion pass 
+Given him by this great conference to know 
+Of things above his world, and of their being 
+Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw 
+Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms, 
+Divine effulgence, whose high power, so far 
+Exceeded human; and his wary speech 
+Thus to the empyreal minister he framed. 
+Inhabitant with God, now know I well 
+Thy favour, in this honour done to Man; 
+Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed 
+To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, 
+Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, 
+As that more willingly thou couldst not seem 
+At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare 
+To whom the winged Hierarch replied. 
+O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom 
+All things proceed, and up to him return, 
+If not depraved from good, created all 
+Such to perfection, one first matter all, 
+Endued with various forms, various degrees 
+Of substance, and, in things that live, of life; 
+But more refined, more spiritous, and pure, 
+As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending 
+Each in their several active spheres assigned, 
+Till body up to spirit work, in bounds 
+Proportioned to each kind.  So from the root 
+Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves 
+More aery, last the bright consummate flower 
+Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit, 
+Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed, 
+To vital spirits aspire, to animal, 
+To intellectual; give both life and sense, 
+Fancy and understanding; whence the soul 
+Reason receives, and reason is her being, 
+Discursive, or intuitive; discourse 
+Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, 
+Differing but in degree, of kind the same. 
+Wonder not then, what God for you saw good 
+If I refuse not, but convert, as you 
+To proper substance.  Time may come, when Men 
+With Angels may participate, and find 
+No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare; 
+And from these corporal nutriments perhaps 
+Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit, 
+Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend 
+Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice, 
+Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell; 
+If ye be found obedient, and retain 
+Unalterably firm his love entire, 
+Whose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy 
+Your fill what happiness this happy state 
+Can comprehend, incapable of more. 
+To whom the patriarch of mankind replied. 
+O favourable Spirit, propitious guest, 
+Well hast thou taught the way that might direct 
+Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set 
+From center to circumference; whereon, 
+In contemplation of created things, 
+By steps we may ascend to God.  But say, 
+What meant that caution joined, If ye be found 
+Obedient?  Can we want obedience then 
+To him, or possibly his love desert, 
+Who formed us from the dust and placed us here 
+Full to the utmost measure of what bliss 
+Human desires can seek or apprehend? 
+To whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth, 
+Attend!  That thou art happy, owe to God; 
+That thou continuest such, owe to thyself, 
+That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. 
+This was that caution given thee; be advised. 
+God made thee perfect, not immutable; 
+And good he made thee, but to persevere 
+He left it in thy power; ordained thy will 
+By nature free, not over-ruled by fate 
+Inextricable, or strict necessity: 
+Our voluntary service he requires, 
+Not our necessitated; such with him 
+Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how 
+Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve 
+Willing or no, who will but what they must 
+By destiny, and can no other choose? 
+Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand 
+In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state 
+Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; 
+On other surety none:  Freely we serve, 
+Because we freely love, as in our will 
+To love or not; in this we stand or fall: 
+And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen, 
+And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall 
+From what high state of bliss, into what woe! 
+To whom our great progenitor.  Thy words 
+Attentive, and with more delighted ear, 
+Divine instructer, I have heard, than when 
+Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills 
+Aereal musick send:  Nor knew I not 
+To be both will and deed created free; 
+Yet that we never shall forget to love 
+Our Maker, and obey him whose command 
+Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts 
+Assured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest 
+Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move, 
+But more desire to hear, if thou consent, 
+The full relation, which must needs be strange, 
+Worthy of sacred silence to be heard; 
+And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun 
+Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins 
+His other half in the great zone of Heaven. 
+Thus Adam made request; and Raphael, 
+After short pause assenting, thus began. 
+High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men, 
+Sad task and hard:  For how shall I relate 
+To human sense the invisible exploits 
+Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse, 
+The ruin of so many glorious once 
+And perfect while they stood? how last unfold 
+The secrets of another world, perhaps 
+Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good 
+This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach 
+Of human sense, I shall delineate so, 
+By likening spiritual to corporal forms, 
+As may express them best; though what if Earth 
+Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein 
+Each to other like, more than on earth is thought? 
+As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild 
+Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests 
+Upon her center poised; when on a day 
+(For time, though in eternity, applied 
+To motion, measures all things durable 
+By present, past, and future,) on such day 
+As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host 
+Of Angels by imperial summons called, 
+Innumerable before the Almighty's throne 
+Forthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared 
+Under their Hierarchs in orders bright: 
+Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced, 
+Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear 
+Stream in the air, and for distinction serve 
+Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees; 
+Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed 
+Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love 
+Recorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs 
+Of circuit inexpressible they stood, 
+Orb within orb, the Father Infinite, 
+By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son, 
+Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top 
+Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. 
+Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light, 
+Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers; 
+Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand. 
+This day I have begot whom I declare 
+My only Son, and on this holy hill 
+Him have anointed, whom ye now behold 
+At my right hand; your head I him appoint; 
+And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow 
+All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord: 
+Under his great vice-gerent reign abide 
+United, as one individual soul, 
+For ever happy:  Him who disobeys, 
+Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day, 
+Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls 
+Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place 
+Ordained without redemption, without end. 
+So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words 
+All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all. 
+That day, as other solemn days, they spent 
+In song and dance about the sacred hill; 
+Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere 
+Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels 
+Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, 
+Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular 
+Then most, when most irregular they seem; 
+And in their motions harmony divine 
+So smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear 
+Listens delighted.  Evening now approached, 
+(For we have also our evening and our morn, 
+We ours for change delectable, not need;) 
+Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn 
+Desirous; all in circles as they stood, 
+Tables are set, and on a sudden piled 
+With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows 
+In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold, 
+Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven. 
+On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned, 
+They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet 
+Quaff immortality and joy, secure 
+Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds 
+Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered 
+With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy. 
+Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled 
+From that high mount of God, whence light and shade 
+Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed 
+To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there 
+In darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed 
+All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest; 
+Wide over all the plain, and wider far 
+Than all this globous earth in plain outspread, 
+(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng, 
+Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend 
+By living streams among the trees of life, 
+Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared, 
+Celestial tabernacles, where they slept 
+Fanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course, 
+Melodious hymns about the sovran throne 
+Alternate all night long: but not so waked 
+Satan; so call him now, his former name 
+Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first, 
+If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power, 
+In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught 
+With envy against the Son of God, that day 
+Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed 
+Messiah King anointed, could not bear 
+Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired. 
+Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain, 
+Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour 
+Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved 
+With all his legions to dislodge, and leave 
+Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme, 
+Contemptuous; and his next subordinate 
+Awakening, thus to him in secret spake. 
+Sleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close 
+Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree 
+Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips 
+Of Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts 
+Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; 
+Both waking we were one; how then can now 
+Thy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed; 
+New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise 
+In us who serve, new counsels to debate 
+What doubtful may ensue:  More in this place 
+To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou 
+Of all those myriads which we lead the chief; 
+Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night 
+Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste, 
+And all who under me their banners wave, 
+Homeward, with flying march, where we possess 
+The quarters of the north; there to prepare 
+Fit entertainment to receive our King, 
+The great Messiah, and his new commands, 
+Who speedily through all the hierarchies 
+Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws. 
+So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused 
+Bad influence into the unwary breast 
+Of his associate:  He together calls, 
+Or several one by one, the regent Powers, 
+Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught, 
+That the Most High commanding, now ere night, 
+Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven, 
+The great hierarchal standard was to move; 
+Tells the suggested cause, and casts between 
+Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound 
+Or taint integrity:  But all obeyed 
+The wonted signal, and superiour voice 
+Of their great Potentate; for great indeed 
+His name, and high was his degree in Heaven; 
+His countenance, as the morning-star that guides 
+The starry flock, allured them, and with lies 
+Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host. 
+Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns 
+Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount, 
+And from within the golden lamps that burn 
+Nightly before him, saw without their light 
+Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread 
+Among the sons of morn, what multitudes 
+Were banded to oppose his high decree; 
+And, smiling, to his only Son thus said. 
+Son, thou in whom my glory I behold 
+In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, 
+Nearly it now concerns us to be sure 
+Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms 
+We mean to hold what anciently we claim 
+Of deity or empire:  Such a foe 
+Is rising, who intends to erect his throne 
+Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north; 
+Nor so content, hath in his thought to try 
+In battle, what our power is, or our right. 
+Let us advise, and to this hazard draw 
+With speed what force is left, and all employ 
+In our defence; lest unawares we lose 
+This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill. 
+To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear, 
+Lightning divine, ineffable, serene, 
+Made answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes 
+Justly hast in derision, and, secure, 
+Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain, 
+Matter to me of glory, whom their hate 
+Illustrates, when they see all regal power 
+Given me to quell their pride, and in event 
+Know whether I be dextrous to subdue 
+Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven. 
+So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers, 
+Far was advanced on winged speed; an host 
+Innumerable as the stars of night, 
+Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun 
+Impearls on every leaf and every flower. 
+Regions they passed, the mighty regencies 
+Of Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones, 
+In their triple degrees; regions to which 
+All thy dominion, Adam, is no more 
+Than what this garden is to all the earth, 
+And all the sea, from one entire globose 
+Stretched into longitude; which having passed, 
+At length into the limits of the north 
+They came; and Satan to his royal seat 
+High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount 
+Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers 
+From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold; 
+The palace of great Lucifer, (so call 
+That structure in the dialect of men 
+Interpreted,) which not long after, he 
+Affecting all equality with God, 
+In imitation of that mount whereon 
+Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven, 
+The Mountain of the Congregation called; 
+For thither he assembled all his train, 
+Pretending so commanded to consult 
+About the great reception of their King, 
+Thither to come, and with calumnious art 
+Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears. 
+Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers; 
+If these magnifick titles yet remain 
+Not merely titular, since by decree 
+Another now hath to himself engrossed 
+All power, and us eclipsed under the name 
+Of King anointed, for whom all this haste 
+Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here, 
+This only to consult how we may best, 
+With what may be devised of honours new, 
+Receive him coming to receive from us 
+Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile! 
+Too much to one! but double how endured, 
+To one, and to his image now proclaimed? 
+But what if better counsels might erect 
+Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke? 
+Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend 
+The supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust 
+To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves 
+Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before 
+By none; and if not equal all, yet free, 
+Equally free; for orders and degrees 
+Jar not with liberty, but well consist. 
+Who can in reason then, or right, assume 
+Monarchy over such as live by right 
+His equals, if in power and splendour less, 
+In freedom equal? or can introduce 
+Law and edict on us, who without law 
+Err not? much less for this to be our Lord, 
+And look for adoration, to the abuse 
+Of those imperial titles, which assert 
+Our being ordained to govern, not to serve. 
+Thus far his bold discourse without controul 
+Had audience; when among the Seraphim 
+Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored 
+The Deity, and divine commands obeyed, 
+Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe 
+The current of his fury thus opposed. 
+O argument blasphemous, false, and proud! 
+Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven 
+Expected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate, 
+In place thyself so high above thy peers. 
+Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn 
+The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn, 
+That to his only Son, by right endued 
+With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven 
+Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due 
+Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest, 
+Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free, 
+And equal over equals to let reign, 
+One over all with unsucceeded power. 
+Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute 
+With him the points of liberty, who made 
+Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven 
+Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being? 
+Yet, by experience taught, we know how good, 
+And of our good and of our dignity 
+How provident he is; how far from thought 
+To make us less, bent rather to exalt 
+Our happy state, under one head more near 
+United.  But to grant it thee unjust, 
+That equal over equals monarch reign: 
+Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count, 
+Or all angelick nature joined in one, 
+Equal to him begotten Son? by whom, 
+As by his Word, the Mighty Father made 
+All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven 
+By him created in their bright degrees, 
+Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named 
+Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers, 
+Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured, 
+But more illustrious made; since he the head 
+One of our number thus reduced becomes; 
+His laws our laws; all honour to him done 
+Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage, 
+And tempt not these; but hasten to appease 
+The incensed Father, and the incensed Son, 
+While pardon may be found in time besought. 
+So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal 
+None seconded, as out of season judged, 
+Or singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced 
+The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied. 
+That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work 
+Of secondary hands, by task transferred 
+From Father to his Son? strange point and new! 
+Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw 
+When this creation was? rememberest thou 
+Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? 
+We know no time when we were not as now; 
+Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised 
+By our own quickening power, when fatal course 
+Had circled his full orb, the birth mature 
+Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons. 
+Our puissance is our own; our own right hand 
+Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try 
+Who is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold 
+Whether by supplication we intend 
+Address, and to begirt the almighty throne 
+Beseeching or besieging.  This report, 
+These tidings carry to the anointed King; 
+And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. 
+He said; and, as the sound of waters deep, 
+Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause 
+Through the infinite host; nor less for that 
+The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone 
+Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold. 
+O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed, 
+Forsaken of all good!  I see thy fall 
+Determined, and thy hapless crew involved 
+In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread 
+Both of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth 
+No more be troubled how to quit the yoke 
+Of God's Messiah; those indulgent laws 
+Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees 
+Against thee are gone forth without recall; 
+That golden scepter, which thou didst reject, 
+Is now an iron rod to bruise and break 
+Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise; 
+Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly 
+These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath 
+Impendent, raging into sudden flame, 
+Distinguish not:  For soon expect to feel 
+His thunder on thy head, devouring fire. 
+Then who created thee lamenting learn, 
+When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. 
+So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found 
+Among the faithless, faithful only he; 
+Among innumerable false, unmoved, 
+Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified, 
+His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal; 
+Nor number, nor example, with him wrought 
+To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind, 
+Though single.  From amidst them forth he passed, 
+Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained 
+Superiour, nor of violence feared aught; 
+And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned 
+On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed. 
+ 
+

+Book VI                                                          
+ 
+ 
+All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued, 
+Through Heaven's wide champain held his way; till Morn, 
+Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand 
+Unbarred the gates of light.  There is a cave 
+Within the mount of God, fast by his throne, 
+Where light and darkness in perpetual round 
+Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven 
+Grateful vicissitude, like day and night; 
+Light issues forth, and at the other door 
+Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour 
+To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well 
+Seem twilight here:  And now went forth the Morn 
+Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold 
+Empyreal; from before her vanished Night, 
+Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain 
+Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright, 
+Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds, 
+Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: 
+War he perceived, war in procinct; and found 
+Already known what he for news had thought 
+To have reported:  Gladly then he mixed 
+Among those friendly Powers, who him received 
+With joy and acclamations loud, that one, 
+That of so many myriads fallen, yet one 
+Returned not lost.  On to the sacred hill 
+They led him high applauded, and present 
+Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice, 
+From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard. 
+Servant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought 
+The better fight, who single hast maintained 
+Against revolted multitudes the cause 
+Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms; 
+And for the testimony of truth hast borne 
+Universal reproach, far worse to bear 
+Than violence; for this was all thy care 
+To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds 
+Judged thee perverse:  The easier conquest now 
+Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, 
+Back on thy foes more glorious to return, 
+Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue 
+By force, who reason for their law refuse, 
+Right reason for their law, and for their King 
+Messiah, who by right of merit reigns. 
+Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince, 
+And thou, in military prowess next, 
+Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons 
+Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints, 
+By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight, 
+Equal in number to that Godless crew 
+Rebellious:  Them with fire and hostile arms 
+Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven 
+Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss, 
+Into their place of punishment, the gulf 
+Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide 
+His fiery Chaos to receive their fall. 
+So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began 
+To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll 
+In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign 
+Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud 
+Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow: 
+At which command the Powers militant, 
+That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined 
+Of union irresistible, moved on 
+In silence their bright legions, to the sound 
+Of instrumental harmony, that breathed 
+Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds 
+Under their God-like leaders, in the cause 
+Of God and his Messiah.  On they move 
+Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill, 
+Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides 
+Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground 
+Their march was, and the passive air upbore 
+Their nimble tread; as when the total kind 
+Of birds, in orderly array on wing, 
+Came summoned over Eden to receive 
+Their names of thee; so over many a tract 
+Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide, 
+Tenfold the length of this terrene:  At last, 
+Far in the horizon to the north appeared 
+From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched 
+In battailous aspect, and nearer view 
+Bristled with upright beams innumerable 
+Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields 
+Various, with boastful argument portrayed, 
+The banded Powers of Satan hasting on 
+With furious expedition; for they weened 
+That self-same day, by fight or by surprise, 
+To win the mount of God, and on his throne 
+To set the Envier of his state, the proud 
+Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain 
+In the mid way:  Though strange to us it seemed 
+At first, that Angel should with Angel war, 
+And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet 
+So oft in festivals of joy and love 
+Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire, 
+Hymning the Eternal Father:  But the shout 
+Of battle now began, and rushing sound 
+Of onset ended soon each milder thought. 
+High in the midst, exalted as a God, 
+The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat, 
+Idol of majesty divine, enclosed 
+With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields; 
+Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now 
+"twixt host and host but narrow space was left, 
+A dreadful interval, and front to front 
+Presented stood in terrible array 
+Of hideous length:  Before the cloudy van, 
+On the rough edge of battle ere it joined, 
+Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced, 
+Came towering, armed in adamant and gold; 
+Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood 
+Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, 
+And thus his own undaunted heart explores. 
+O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest 
+Should yet remain, where faith and realty 
+Remain not:  Wherefore should not strength and might 
+There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove 
+Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable? 
+His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid, 
+I mean to try, whose reason I have tried 
+Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, 
+That he, who in debate of truth hath won, 
+Should win in arms, in both disputes alike 
+Victor; though brutish that contest and foul, 
+When reason hath to deal with force, yet so 
+Most reason is that reason overcome. 
+So pondering, and from his armed peers 
+Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met 
+His daring foe, at this prevention more 
+Incensed, and thus securely him defied. 
+Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached 
+The highth of thy aspiring unopposed, 
+The throne of God unguarded, and his side 
+Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power 
+Or potent tongue:  Fool!not to think how vain 
+Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms; 
+Who out of smallest things could, without end, 
+Have raised incessant armies to defeat 
+Thy folly; or with solitary hand 
+Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow, 
+Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed 
+Thy legions under darkness:  But thou seest 
+All are not of thy train; there be, who faith 
+Prefer, and piety to God, though then 
+To thee not visible, when I alone 
+Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent 
+From all:  My sect thou seest;now learn too late 
+How few sometimes may know, when thousands err. 
+Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance, 
+Thus answered.  Ill for thee, but in wished hour 
+Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest 
+From flight, seditious Angel! to receive 
+Thy merited reward, the first assay 
+Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue, 
+Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose 
+A third part of the Gods, in synod met 
+Their deities to assert; who, while they feel 
+Vigour divine within them, can allow 
+Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comest 
+Before thy fellows, ambitious to win 
+From me some plume, that thy success may show 
+Destruction to the rest:  This pause between, 
+(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know, 
+At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven 
+To heavenly souls had been all one; but now 
+I see that most through sloth had rather serve, 
+Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song! 
+Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven, 
+Servility with freedom to contend, 
+As both their deeds compared this day shall prove. 
+To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied. 
+Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find 
+Of erring, from the path of truth remote: 
+Unjustly thou depravest it with the name 
+Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains, 
+Or Nature:  God and Nature bid the same, 
+When he who rules is worthiest, and excels 
+Them whom he governs.  This is servitude, 
+To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled 
+Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, 
+Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled; 
+Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid. 
+Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve 
+In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine 
+Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed; 
+Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect:  Mean while 
+From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight, 
+This greeting on thy impious crest receive. 
+So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, 
+Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell 
+On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight, 
+Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield, 
+Such ruin intercept:  Ten paces huge 
+He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee 
+His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth 
+Winds under ground, or waters forcing way, 
+Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat, 
+Half sunk with all his pines.  Amazement seised 
+The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see 
+Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout, 
+Presage of victory, and fierce desire 
+Of battle:  Whereat Michael bid sound 
+The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven 
+It sounded, and the faithful armies rung 
+Hosanna to the Highest:  Nor stood at gaze 
+The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined 
+The horrid shock.  Now storming fury rose, 
+And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now 
+Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed 
+Horrible discord, and the madding wheels 
+Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise 
+Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss 
+Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew, 
+And flying vaulted either host with fire. 
+So under fiery cope together rushed 
+Both battles main, with ruinous assault 
+And inextinguishable rage.  All Heaven 
+Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth 
+Had to her center shook.  What wonder? when 
+Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought 
+On either side, the least of whom could wield 
+These elements, and arm him with the force 
+Of all their regions:  How much more of power 
+Army against army numberless to raise 
+Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, 
+Though not destroy, their happy native seat; 
+Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent, 
+From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled 
+And limited their might; though numbered such 
+As each divided legion might have seemed 
+A numerous host; in strength each armed hand 
+A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed 
+Each warriour single as in chief, expert 
+When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway 
+Of battle, open when, and when to close 
+The ridges of grim war:  No thought of flight, 
+None of retreat, no unbecoming deed 
+That argued fear; each on himself relied, 
+As only in his arm the moment lay 
+Of victory:  Deeds of eternal fame 
+Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread 
+That war and various; sometimes on firm ground 
+A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing, 
+Tormented all the air; all air seemed then 
+Conflicting fire.  Long time in even scale 
+The battle hung; till Satan, who that day 
+Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms 
+No equal, ranging through the dire attack 
+Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length 
+Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled 
+Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway 
+Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down 
+Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand 
+He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb 
+Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield, 
+A vast circumference.  At his approach 
+The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil 
+Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end 
+Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued 
+Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown 
+And visage all inflamed first thus began. 
+Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, 
+Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest 
+These acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, 
+Though heaviest by just measure on thyself, 
+And thy  adherents:  How hast thou disturbed 
+Heaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought 
+Misery, uncreated till the crime 
+Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled 
+Thy malice into thousands, once upright 
+And faithful, now proved false!  But think not here 
+To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out 
+From all her confines.  Heaven, the seat of bliss, 
+Brooks not the works of violence and war. 
+Hence then, and evil go with thee along, 
+Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell; 
+Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils, 
+Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom, 
+Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God, 
+Precipitate thee with augmented pain. 
+So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus 
+The Adversary.  Nor think thou with wind 
+Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds 
+Thou canst not.  Hast thou turned the least of these 
+To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise 
+Unvanquished, easier to transact with me 
+That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats 
+To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end 
+The strife which thou callest evil, but we style 
+The strife of glory; which we mean to win, 
+Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell 
+Thou fablest; here however to dwell free, 
+If not to reign:  Mean while thy utmost force, 
+And join him named Almighty to thy aid, 
+I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh. 
+They ended parle, and both addressed for fight 
+Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue 
+Of Angels, can relate, or to what things 
+Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift 
+Human imagination to such highth 
+Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed, 
+Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms, 
+Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven. 
+Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air 
+Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields 
+Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood 
+In horrour:  From each hand with speed retired, 
+Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng, 
+And left large field, unsafe within the wind 
+Of such commotion; such as, to set forth 
+Great things by small, if, nature's concord broke, 
+Among the constellations war were sprung, 
+Two planets, rushing from aspect malign 
+Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky 
+Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound. 
+Together both with next to almighty arm 
+Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed 
+That might determine, and not need repeat, 
+As not of power at once; nor odds appeared 
+In might or swift prevention:  But the sword 
+Of Michael from the armoury of God 
+Was given him tempered so, that neither keen 
+Nor solid might resist that edge: it met 
+The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite 
+Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid, 
+But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared 
+All his right side:  Then Satan first knew pain, 
+And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore 
+The griding sword with discontinuous wound 
+Passed through him:  But the ethereal substance closed, 
+Not long divisible; and from the gash 
+A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed 
+Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed, 
+And all his armour stained, ere while so bright. 
+Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run 
+By Angels many and strong, who interposed 
+Defence, while others bore him on their shields 
+Back to his chariot, where it stood retired 
+From off the files of war:  There they him laid 
+Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame, 
+To find himself not matchless, and his pride 
+Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath 
+His confidence to equal God in power. 
+Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout 
+Vital in every part, not as frail man 
+In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins, 
+Cannot but by annihilating die; 
+Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound 
+Receive, no more than can the fluid air: 
+All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear, 
+All intellect, all sense; and, as they please, 
+They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size 
+Assume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare. 
+Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved 
+Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, 
+And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array 
+Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied, 
+And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound 
+Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven 
+Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon 
+Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms 
+And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing 
+Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe, 
+Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed, 
+Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai, 
+Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods 
+Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight, 
+Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail. 
+Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy 
+The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow 
+Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence 
+Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew. 
+I might relate of thousands, and their names 
+Eternize here on earth; but those elect 
+Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven, 
+Seek not the praise of men:  The other sort, 
+In might though wonderous and in acts of war, 
+Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom 
+Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory, 
+Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. 
+For strength from truth divided, and from just, 
+Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise 
+And ignominy; yet to glory aspires 
+Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame: 
+Therefore eternal silence be their doom. 
+And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved, 
+With many an inroad gored; deformed rout 
+Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground 
+With shivered armour strown, and on a heap 
+Chariot and charioteer lay overturned, 
+And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled 
+O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host 
+Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised, 
+Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain, 
+Fled ignominious, to such evil brought 
+By sin of disobedience; till that hour 
+Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain. 
+Far otherwise the inviolable Saints, 
+In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire, 
+Invulnerable, impenetrably armed; 
+Such high advantages their innocence 
+Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned, 
+Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood 
+Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained 
+By wound, though from their place by violence moved, 
+Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven 
+Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed, 
+And silence on the odious din of war: 
+Under her cloudy covert both retired, 
+Victor and vanquished:  On the foughten field 
+Michael and his Angels prevalent 
+Encamping, placed in guard their watches round, 
+Cherubick waving fires:  On the other part, 
+Satan with his rebellious disappeared, 
+Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest, 
+His potentates to council called by night; 
+And in the midst thus undismayed began. 
+O now in danger tried, now known in arms 
+Not to be overpowered, Companions dear, 
+Found worthy not of liberty alone, 
+Too mean pretence! but what we more affect, 
+Honour, dominion, glory, and renown; 
+Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight, 
+(And if one day, why not eternal days?) 
+What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send 
+Against us from about his throne, and judged 
+Sufficient to subdue us to his will, 
+But proves not so:  Then fallible, it seems, 
+Of future we may deem him, though till now 
+Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armed, 
+Some disadvantage we endured and pain, 
+Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned; 
+Since now we find this our empyreal form 
+Incapable of mortal injury, 
+Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound, 
+Soon closing, and by native vigour healed. 
+Of evil then so small as easy think 
+The remedy; perhaps more valid arms, 
+Weapons more violent, when next we meet, 
+May serve to better us, and worse our foes, 
+Or equal what between us made the odds, 
+In nature none:  If other hidden cause 
+Left them superiour, while we can preserve 
+Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound, 
+Due search and consultation will disclose. 
+He sat; and in the assembly next upstood 
+Nisroch, of Principalities the prime; 
+As one he stood escaped from cruel fight, 
+Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn, 
+And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake. 
+Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free 
+Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard 
+For Gods, and too unequal work we find, 
+Against unequal arms to fight in pain, 
+Against unpained, impassive; from which evil 
+Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails 
+Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain 
+Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands 
+Of mightiest?  Sense of pleasure we may well 
+Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, 
+But live content, which is the calmest life: 
+But pain is perfect misery, the worst 
+Of evils, and, excessive, overturns 
+All patience.  He, who therefore can invent 
+With what more forcible we may offend 
+Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm 
+Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves 
+No less than for deliverance what we owe. 
+Whereto with look composed Satan replied. 
+Not uninvented that, which thou aright 
+Believest so main to our success, I bring. 
+Which of us who beholds the bright surface 
+Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand, 
+This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned 
+With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold; 
+Whose eye so superficially surveys 
+These things, as not to mind from whence they grow 
+Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, 
+Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touched 
+With Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth 
+So beauteous, opening to the ambient light? 
+These in their dark nativity the deep 
+Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame; 
+Which, into hollow engines, long and round, 
+Thick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire 
+Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth 
+From far, with thundering noise, among our foes 
+Such implements of mischief, as shall dash 
+To pieces, and o'erwhelm whatever stands 
+Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed 
+The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. 
+Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn, 
+Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive; 
+Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined 
+Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired. 
+He ended, and his words their drooping cheer 
+Enlightened, and their languished hope revived. 
+The invention all admired, and each, how he 
+To be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed 
+Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought 
+Impossible:  Yet, haply, of thy race 
+In future days, if malice should abound, 
+Some one intent on mischief, or inspired 
+With devilish machination, might devise 
+Like instrument to plague the sons of men 
+For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent. 
+Forthwith from council to the work they flew; 
+None arguing stood; innumerable hands 
+Were ready; in a moment up they turned 
+Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath 
+The originals of nature in their crude 
+Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam 
+They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art, 
+Concocted and adusted they reduced 
+To blackest grain, and into store conveyed: 
+Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth 
+Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone, 
+Whereof to found their engines and their balls 
+Of missive ruin; part incentive reed 
+Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. 
+So all ere day-spring, under conscious night, 
+Secret they finished, and in order set, 
+With silent circumspection, unespied. 
+Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared, 
+Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms 
+The matin trumpet sung:  In arms they stood 
+Of golden panoply, refulgent host, 
+Soon banded; others from the dawning hills 
+Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour, 
+Each quarter to descry the distant foe, 
+Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight, 
+In motion or in halt:  Him soon they met 
+Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow 
+But firm battalion; back with speediest sail 
+Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, 
+Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried. 
+Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand, 
+Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit 
+This day; fear not his flight;so thick a cloud 
+He comes, and settled in his face I see 
+Sad resolution, and secure:  Let each 
+His adamantine coat gird well, and each 
+Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield, 
+Borne even or high; for this day will pour down, 
+If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower, 
+But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire. 
+So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon 
+In order, quit of all impediment; 
+Instant without disturb they took alarm, 
+And onward moved embattled:  When behold! 
+Not distant far with heavy pace the foe 
+Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube 
+Training his devilish enginery, impaled 
+On every side with shadowing squadrons deep, 
+To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood 
+A while; but suddenly at head appeared 
+Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud. 
+Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold; 
+That all may see who hate us, how we seek 
+Peace and composure, and with open breast 
+Stand ready to receive them, if they like 
+Our overture; and turn not back perverse: 
+But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven! 
+Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge 
+Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand 
+Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch 
+What we propound, and loud that all may hear! 
+So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce 
+Had ended; when to right and left the front 
+Divided, and to either flank retired: 
+Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange, 
+A triple mounted row of pillars laid 
+On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed, 
+Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir, 
+With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,) 
+Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths 
+With hideous orifice gaped on us wide, 
+Portending hollow truce:  At each behind 
+A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed 
+Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense, 
+Collected stood within our thoughts amused, 
+Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds 
+Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied 
+With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame, 
+But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared, 
+From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar 
+Embowelled with outrageous noise the air, 
+And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul 
+Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail 
+Of iron globes; which, on the victor host 
+Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote, 
+That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand, 
+Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell 
+By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled; 
+The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might 
+Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift 
+By quick contraction or remove; but now 
+Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout; 
+Nor served it to relax their serried files. 
+What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse 
+Repeated, and indecent overthrow 
+Doubled, would render them yet more despised, 
+And to their foes a laughter; for in view 
+Stood ranked of Seraphim another row, 
+In posture to displode their second tire 
+Of thunder:  Back defeated to return 
+They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight, 
+And to his mates thus in derision called. 
+O Friends! why come not on these victors proud 
+Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we, 
+To entertain them fair with open front 
+And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms 
+Of composition, straight they changed their minds, 
+Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, 
+As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed 
+Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps 
+For joy of offered peace:  But I suppose, 
+If our proposals once again were heard, 
+We should compel them to a quick result. 
+To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood. 
+Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight, 
+Of hard contents, and full of force urged home; 
+Such as we might perceive amused them all, 
+And stumbled many:  Who receives them right, 
+Had need from head to foot well understand; 
+Not understood, this gift they have besides, 
+They show us when our foes walk not upright. 
+So they among themselves in pleasant vein 
+Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond 
+All doubt of victory:  Eternal Might 
+To match with their inventions they presumed 
+So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn, 
+And all his host derided, while they stood 
+A while in trouble:  But they stood not long; 
+Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms 
+Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. 
+Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power, 
+Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!) 
+Their arms away they threw, and to the hills 
+(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven 
+Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,) 
+Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew; 
+From their foundations loosening to and fro, 
+They plucked the seated hills, with all their load, 
+Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops 
+Up-lifting bore them in their hands:  Amaze, 
+Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host, 
+When coming towards them so dread they saw 
+The bottom of the mountains upward turned; 
+Till on those cursed engines' triple-row 
+They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence 
+Under the weight of mountains buried deep; 
+Themselves invaded next, and on their heads 
+Main promontories flung, which in the air 
+Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed; 
+Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised 
+Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain 
+Implacable, and many a dolorous groan; 
+Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind 
+Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, 
+Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. 
+The rest, in imitation, to like arms 
+Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore: 
+So hills amid the air encountered hills, 
+Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire; 
+That under ground they fought in dismal shade; 
+Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game 
+To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped 
+Upon confusion rose:  And now all Heaven 
+Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread; 
+Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits 
+Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure, 
+Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen 
+This tumult, and permitted all, advised: 
+That his great purpose he might so fulfil, 
+To honour his anointed Son avenged 
+Upon his enemies, and to declare 
+All power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son, 
+The Assessour of his throne, he thus began. 
+Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved, 
+Son, in whose face invisible is beheld 
+Visibly, what by Deity I am; 
+And in whose hand what by decree I do, 
+Second Omnipotence! two days are past, 
+Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven, 
+Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame 
+These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight, 
+As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed; 
+For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest, 
+Equal in their creation they were formed, 
+Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought 
+Insensibly, for I suspend their doom; 
+Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last 
+Endless, and no solution will be found: 
+War wearied hath performed what war can do, 
+And to disordered rage let loose the reins 
+With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes 
+Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main. 
+Two days are therefore past, the third is thine; 
+For thee I have ordained it; and thus far 
+Have suffered, that the glory may be thine 
+Of ending this great war, since none but Thou 
+Can end it.  Into thee such virtue and grace 
+Immense I have transfused, that all may know 
+In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare; 
+And, this perverse commotion governed thus, 
+To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir 
+Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King 
+By sacred unction, thy deserved right. 
+Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might; 
+Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels 
+That shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war, 
+My bow and thunder, my almighty arms 
+Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh; 
+Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out 
+From all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep: 
+There let them learn, as likes them, to despise 
+God, and Messiah his anointed King. 
+He said, and on his Son with rays direct 
+Shone full; he all his Father full expressed 
+Ineffably into his face received; 
+And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake. 
+O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones, 
+First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st 
+To glorify thy Son, I always thee, 
+As is most just:  This I my glory account, 
+My exaltation, and my whole delight, 
+That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will 
+Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss. 
+Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume, 
+And gladlier shall resign, when in the end 
+Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee 
+For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest: 
+But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on 
+Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on, 
+Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, 
+Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled; 
+To their prepared ill mansion driven down, 
+To chains of darkness, and the undying worm; 
+That from thy just obedience could revolt, 
+Whom to obey is happiness entire. 
+Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure 
+Far separate, circling thy holy mount, 
+Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing, 
+Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief. 
+So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose 
+From the right hand of Glory where he sat; 
+And the third sacred morn began to shine, 
+Dawning through Heaven.  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound 
+The chariot of Paternal Deity, 
+Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn, 
+Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed 
+By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each 
+Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all 
+And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels 
+Of beryl, and careering fires between; 
+Over their heads a crystal firmament, 
+Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure 
+Amber, and colours of the showery arch. 
+He, in celestial panoply all armed 
+Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, 
+Ascended; at his right hand Victory 
+Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow 
+And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored; 
+And from about him fierce effusion rolled 
+Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire: 
+Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, 
+He onward came; far off his coming shone; 
+And twenty thousand (I their number heard) 
+Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen; 
+He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime 
+On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned, 
+Illustrious far and wide; but by his own 
+First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised, 
+When the great ensign of Messiah blazed 
+Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven; 
+Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced 
+His army, circumfused on either wing, 
+Under their Head imbodied all in one. 
+Before him Power Divine his way prepared; 
+At his command the uprooted hills retired 
+Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went 
+Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, 
+And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled. 
+This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured, 
+And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, 
+Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. 
+In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? 
+But to convince the proud what signs avail, 
+Or wonders move the obdurate to relent? 
+They, hardened more by what might most reclaim, 
+Grieving to see his glory, at the sight 
+Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth, 
+Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud 
+Weening to prosper, and at length prevail 
+Against God and Messiah, or to fall 
+In universal ruin last; and now 
+To final battle drew, disdaining flight, 
+Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God 
+To all his host on either hand thus spake. 
+Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand, 
+Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest: 
+Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God 
+Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause; 
+And as ye have received, so have ye done, 
+Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew 
+The punishment to other hand belongs; 
+Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints: 
+Number to this day's work is not ordained, 
+Nor multitude; stand only, and behold 
+God's indignation on these godless poured 
+By me; not you, but me, they have despised, 
+Yet envied; against me is all their rage, 
+Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme 
+Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains, 
+Hath honoured me, according to his will. 
+Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned; 
+That they may have their wish, to try with me 
+In battle which the stronger proves; they all, 
+Or I alone against them; since by strength 
+They measure all, of other excellence 
+Not emulous, nor care who them excels; 
+Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe. 
+So spake the Son, and into terrour changed 
+His countenance too severe to be beheld, 
+And full of wrath bent on his enemies. 
+At once the Four spread out their starry wings 
+With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs 
+Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound 
+Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host. 
+He on his impious foes right onward drove, 
+Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels 
+The stedfast empyrean shook throughout, 
+All but the throne itself of God.  Full soon 
+Among them he arrived; in his right hand 
+Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent 
+Before him, such as in their souls infixed 
+Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost, 
+All courage; down their idle weapons dropt: 
+O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode 
+Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, 
+That wished the mountains now might be again 
+Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire. 
+Nor less on either side tempestuous fell 
+His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four 
+Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels 
+Distinct alike with multitude of eyes; 
+One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye 
+Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire 
+Among the accursed, that withered all their strength, 
+And of their wonted vigour left them drained, 
+Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen. 
+Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked 
+His thunder in mid volley; for he meant 
+Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven: 
+The overthrown he raised, and as a herd 
+Of goats or timorous flock together thronged 
+Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued 
+With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds 
+And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide, 
+Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed 
+Into the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight 
+Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse 
+Urged them behind:  Headlong themselves they threw 
+Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath 
+Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. 
+Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw 
+Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled 
+Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep 
+Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. 
+Nine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared, 
+And felt tenfold confusion in their fall 
+Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout 
+Incumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last 
+Yawning received them whole, and on them closed; 
+Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire 
+Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain. 
+Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired 
+Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled. 
+Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes, 
+Messiah his triumphal chariot turned: 
+To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood 
+Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts, 
+With jubilee advanced; and, as they went, 
+Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright, 
+Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King, 
+Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given, 
+Worthiest to reign:  He, celebrated, rode 
+Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts 
+And temple of his Mighty Father throned 
+On high; who into glory him received, 
+Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. 
+Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth, 
+At thy request, and that thou mayest beware 
+By what is past, to thee I have revealed 
+What might have else to human race been hid; 
+The discord which befel, and war in Heaven 
+Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall 
+Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled 
+With Satan; he who envies now thy state, 
+Who now is plotting how he may seduce 
+Thee also from obedience, that, with him 
+Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake 
+His punishment, eternal misery; 
+Which would be all his solace and revenge, 
+As a despite done against the Most High, 
+Thee once to gain companion of his woe. 
+But listen not to his temptations, warn 
+Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard, 
+By terrible example, the reward 
+Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, 
+Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.

+Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name 
+If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine 
+Following, above the Olympian hill I soar, 
+Above the flight of Pegasean wing! 
+The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou 
+Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top 
+Of old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born, 
+Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed, 
+Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse, 
+Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play 
+In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased 
+With thy celestial song.  Up led by thee 
+Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed, 
+An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air, 
+Thy tempering: with like safety guided down 
+Return me to my native element: 
+Lest from this flying steed unreined, (as once 
+Bellerophon, though from a lower clime,) 
+Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall, 
+Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn. 
+Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound 
+Within the visible diurnal sphere; 
+Standing on earth, not rapt above the pole, 
+More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged 
+To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days, 
+On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues; 
+In darkness, and with dangers compassed round, 
+And solitude; yet not alone, while thou 
+Visitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn 
+Purples the east: still govern thou my song, 
+Urania, and fit audience find, though few. 
+But drive far off the barbarous dissonance 
+Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race 
+Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard 
+In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears 
+To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned 
+Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend 
+Her son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores: 
+For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream. 
+Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael, 
+The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned 
+Adam, by dire example, to beware 
+Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven 
+To those apostates; lest the like befall 
+In Paradise to Adam or his race, 
+Charged not to touch the interdicted tree, 
+If they transgress, and slight that sole command, 
+So easily obeyed amid the choice 
+Of all tastes else to please their appetite, 
+Though wandering.  He, with his consorted Eve, 
+The story heard attentive, and was filled 
+With admiration and deep muse, to hear 
+Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought 
+So unimaginable, as hate in Heaven, 
+And war so near the peace of God in bliss, 
+With such confusion: but the evil, soon 
+Driven back, redounded as a flood on those 
+From whom it sprung; impossible to mix 
+With blessedness.  Whence Adam soon repealed 
+The doubts that in his heart arose: and now 
+Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know 
+What nearer might concern him, how this world 
+Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began; 
+When, and whereof created; for what cause; 
+What within Eden, or without, was done 
+Before his memory; as one whose drouth 
+Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream, 
+Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, 
+Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest. 
+Great things, and full of wonder in our ears, 
+Far differing from this world, thou hast revealed, 
+Divine interpreter! by favour sent 
+Down from the empyrean, to forewarn 
+Us timely of what might else have been our loss, 
+Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach; 
+For which to the infinitely Good we owe 
+Immortal thanks, and his admonishment 
+Receive, with solemn purpose to observe 
+Immutably his sovran will, the end 
+Of what we are.  But since thou hast vouchsafed 
+Gently, for our instruction, to impart 
+Things above earthly thought, which yet concerned 
+Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed, 
+Deign to descend now lower, and relate 
+What may no less perhaps avail us known, 
+How first began this Heaven which we behold 
+Distant so high, with moving fires adorned 
+Innumerable; and this which yields or fills 
+All space, the ambient air wide interfused 
+Embracing round this floried Earth; what cause 
+Moved the Creator, in his holy rest 
+Through all eternity, so late to build 
+In Chaos; and the work begun, how soon 
+Absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold 
+What we, not to explore the secrets ask 
+Of his eternal empire, but the more 
+To magnify his works, the more we know. 
+And the great light of day yet wants to run 
+Much of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven, 
+Held by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears, 
+And longer will delay to hear thee tell 
+His generation, and the rising birth 
+Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: 
+Or if the star of evening and the moon 
+Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring, 
+Silence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch; 
+Or we can bid his absence, till thy song 
+End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine. 
+Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought: 
+And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild. 
+This also thy request, with caution asked, 
+Obtain; though to recount almighty works 
+What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, 
+Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? 
+Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve 
+To glorify the Maker, and infer 
+Thee also happier, shall not be withheld 
+Thy hearing; such commission from above 
+I have received, to answer thy desire 
+Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain 
+To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope 
+Things not revealed, which the invisible King, 
+Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night; 
+To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: 
+Enough is left besides to search and know. 
+But knowledge is as food, and needs no less 
+Her temperance over appetite, to know 
+In measure what the mind may well contain; 
+Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns 
+Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind. 
+Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven 
+(So call him, brighter once amidst the host 
+Of Angels, than that star the stars among,) 
+Fell with his flaming legions through the deep 
+Into his place, and the great Son returned 
+Victorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent 
+Eternal Father from his throne beheld 
+Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake. 
+At least our envious Foe hath failed, who thought 
+All like himself rebellious, by whose aid 
+This inaccessible high strength, the seat 
+Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed, 
+He trusted to have seised, and into fraud 
+Drew many, whom their place knows here no more: 
+Yet far the greater part have kept, I see, 
+Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains 
+Number sufficient to possess her realms 
+Though wide, and this high temple to frequent 
+With ministeries due, and solemn rites: 
+But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm 
+Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven, 
+My damage fondly deemed, I can repair 
+That detriment, if such it be to lose 
+Self-lost; and in a moment will create 
+Another world, out of one man a race 
+Of men innumerable, there to dwell, 
+Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised, 
+They open to themselves at length the way 
+Up hither, under long obedience tried; 
+And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth, 
+One kingdom, joy and union without end. 
+Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven; 
+And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee 
+This I perform; speak thou, and be it done! 
+My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee 
+I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep 
+Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth; 
+Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill 
+Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. 
+Though I, uncircumscribed myself, retire, 
+And put not forth my goodness, which is free 
+To act or not, Necessity and Chance 
+Approach not me, and what I will is Fate. 
+So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake 
+His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. 
+Immediate are the acts of God, more swift 
+Than time or motion, but to human ears 
+Cannot without process of speech be told, 
+So told as earthly notion can receive. 
+Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven, 
+When such was heard declared the Almighty's will; 
+Glory they sung to the Most High, good will 
+To future men, and in their dwellings peace; 
+Glory to Him, whose just avenging ire 
+Had driven out the ungodly from his sight 
+And the habitations of the just; to Him 
+Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained 
+Good out of evil to create; instead 
+Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring 
+Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse 
+His good to worlds and ages infinite. 
+So sang the Hierarchies:  Mean while the Son 
+On his great expedition now appeared, 
+Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned 
+Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love 
+Immense, and all his Father in him shone. 
+About his chariot numberless were poured 
+Cherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones, 
+And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged 
+From the armoury of God; where stand of old 
+Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged 
+Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand, 
+Celestial equipage; and now came forth 
+Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived, 
+Attendant on their Lord:  Heaven opened wide 
+Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound 
+On golden hinges moving, to let forth 
+The King of Glory, in his powerful Word 
+And Spirit, coming to create new worlds. 
+On heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore 
+They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss 
+Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild, 
+Up from the bottom turned by furious winds 
+And surging waves, as mountains, to assault 
+Heaven's highth, and with the center mix the pole. 
+Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace, 
+Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end! 
+Nor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim 
+Uplifted, in paternal glory rode 
+Far into Chaos, and the world unborn; 
+For Chaos heard his voice:  Him all his train 
+Followed in bright procession, to behold 
+Creation, and the wonders of his might. 
+Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand 
+He took the golden compasses, prepared 
+In God's eternal store, to circumscribe 
+This universe, and all created things: 
+One foot he centered, and the other turned 
+Round through the vast profundity obscure; 
+And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds, 
+This be thy just circumference, O World! 
+Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth, 
+Matter unformed and void:  Darkness profound 
+Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm 
+His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread, 
+And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth 
+Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged 
+The black tartareous cold infernal dregs, 
+Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed 
+Like things to like; the rest to several place 
+Disparted, and between spun out the air; 
+And Earth self-balanced on her center hung. 
+Let there be light, said God; and forthwith Light 
+Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure, 
+Sprung from the deep; and from her native east 
+To journey through the aery gloom began, 
+Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun 
+Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle 
+Sojourned the while.  God saw the light was good; 
+And light from darkness by the hemisphere 
+Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night, 
+He named.  Thus was the first day even and morn: 
+Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung 
+By the celestial quires, when orient light 
+Exhaling first from darkness they beheld; 
+Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout 
+The hollow universal orb they filled, 
+And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised 
+God and his works; Creator him they sung, 
+Both when first evening was, and when first morn. 
+Again, God said,  Let there be firmament 
+Amid the waters, and let it divide 
+The waters from the waters; and God made 
+The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, 
+Transparent, elemental air, diffused 
+In circuit to the uttermost convex 
+Of this great round; partition firm and sure, 
+The waters underneath from those above 
+Dividing: for as earth, so he the world 
+Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide 
+Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule 
+Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes 
+Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: 
+And Heaven he named the Firmament:  So even 
+And morning chorus sung the second day. 
+The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet 
+Of waters, embryon immature involved, 
+Appeared not: over all the face of Earth 
+Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm 
+Prolifick humour softening all her globe, 
+Fermented the great mother to conceive, 
+Satiate with genial moisture; when God said, 
+Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven 
+Into one place, and let dry land appear. 
+Immediately the mountains huge appear 
+Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave 
+Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky: 
+So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low 
+Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, 
+Capacious bed of waters:  Thither they 
+Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled, 
+As drops on dust conglobing from the dry: 
+Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct, 
+For haste; such flight the great command impressed 
+On the swift floods:  As armies at the call 
+Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard) 
+Troop to their standard; so the watery throng, 
+Wave rolling after wave, where way they found, 
+If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain, 
+Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill; 
+But they, or under ground, or circuit wide 
+With serpent errour wandering, found their way, 
+And on the washy oose deep channels wore; 
+Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry, 
+All but within those banks, where rivers now 
+Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train. 
+The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle 
+Of congregated waters, he called Seas: 
+And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth 
+Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed, 
+And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind, 
+Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth. 
+He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then 
+Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned, 
+Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad 
+Her universal face with pleasant green; 
+Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered 
+Opening their various colours, and made gay 
+Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown, 
+Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept 
+The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed 
+Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub, 
+And bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last 
+Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread 
+Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed 
+Their blossoms:  With high woods the hills were crowned; 
+With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side; 
+With borders long the rivers: that Earth now 
+Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell, 
+Or wander with delight, and love to haunt 
+Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained 
+Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground 
+None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist 
+Went up, and watered all the ground, and each 
+Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth, 
+God made, and every herb, before it grew 
+On the green stem:  God saw that it was good: 
+So even and morn recorded the third day. 
+Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights 
+High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide 
+The day from night; and let them be for signs, 
+For seasons, and for days, and circling years; 
+And let them be for lights, as I ordain 
+Their office in the firmament of Heaven, 
+To give light on the Earth; and it was so. 
+And God made two great lights, great for their use 
+To Man, the greater to have rule by day, 
+The less by night, altern; and made the stars, 
+And set them in the firmament of Heaven 
+To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day 
+In their vicissitude, and rule the night, 
+And light from darkness to divide.  God saw, 
+Surveying his great work, that it was good: 
+For of celestial bodies first the sun 
+A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first, 
+Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon 
+Globose, and every magnitude of stars, 
+And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field: 
+Of light by far the greater part he took, 
+Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed 
+In the sun's orb, made porous to receive 
+And drink the liquid light; firm to retain 
+Her gathered beams, great palace now of light. 
+Hither, as to their fountain, other stars 
+Repairing, in their golden urns draw light, 
+And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns; 
+By tincture or reflection they augment 
+Their small peculiar, though from human sight 
+So far remote, with diminution seen, 
+First in his east the glorious lamp was seen, 
+Regent of day, and all the horizon round 
+Invested with bright rays, jocund to run 
+His longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray 
+Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced, 
+Shedding sweet influence:  Less bright the moon, 
+But opposite in levelled west was set, 
+His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light 
+From him; for other light she needed none 
+In that aspect, and still that distance keeps 
+Till night; then in the east her turn she shines, 
+Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign 
+With thousand lesser lights dividual holds, 
+With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared 
+Spangling the hemisphere:  Then first adorned 
+With their bright luminaries that set and rose, 
+Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day. 
+And God said, Let the waters generate 
+Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul: 
+And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings 
+Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven. 
+And God created the great whales, and each 
+Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously 
+The waters generated by their kinds; 
+And every bird of wing after his kind; 
+And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying. 
+Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas, 
+And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill; 
+And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth. 
+Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay, 
+With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals 
+Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales, 
+Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft 
+Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate, 
+Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves 
+Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance, 
+Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold; 
+Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend 
+Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food 
+In jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal 
+And bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk 
+Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait, 
+Tempest the ocean: there leviathan, 
+Hugest of living creatures, on the deep 
+Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims, 
+And seems a moving land; and at his gills 
+Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea. 
+Mean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores, 
+Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon 
+Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed 
+Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge 
+They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime, 
+With clang despised the ground, under a cloud 
+In prospect; there the eagle and the stork 
+On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build: 
+Part loosely wing the region, part more wise 
+In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way, 
+Intelligent of seasons, and set forth 
+Their aery caravan, high over seas 
+Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing 
+Easing their flight; so steers the prudent crane 
+Her annual voyage, borne on winds; the air 
+Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes: 
+From branch to branch the smaller birds with song 
+Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings 
+Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale 
+Ceased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays: 
+Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed 
+Their downy breast; the swan with arched neck, 
+Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows 
+Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit 
+The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower 
+The mid aereal sky:  Others on ground 
+Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds 
+The silent hours, and the other whose gay train 
+Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue 
+Of rainbows and starry eyes.  The waters thus 
+With fish replenished, and the air with fowl, 
+Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day. 
+The sixth, and of creation last, arose 
+With evening harps and matin; when God said, 
+Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind, 
+Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth, 
+Each in their kind.  The Earth obeyed, and straight 
+Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth 
+Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms, 
+Limbed and full grown:  Out of the ground up rose, 
+As from his lair, the wild beast where he wons 
+In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den; 
+Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked: 
+The cattle in the fields and meadows green: 
+Those rare and solitary, these in flocks 
+Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung. 
+The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared 
+The tawny lion, pawing to get free 
+His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds, 
+And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce, 
+The libbard, and the tiger, as the mole 
+Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw 
+In hillocks:  The swift stag from under ground 
+Bore up his branching head:  Scarce from his mould 
+Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved 
+His vastness:  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose, 
+As plants:  Ambiguous between sea and land 
+The river-horse, and scaly crocodile. 
+At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, 
+Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans 
+For wings, and smallest lineaments exact 
+In all the liveries decked of summer's pride 
+With spots of gold and purple, azure and green: 
+These, as a line, their long dimension drew, 
+Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all 
+Minims of nature; some of serpent-kind, 
+Wonderous in length and corpulence, involved 
+Their snaky folds, and added wings.  First crept 
+The parsimonious emmet, provident 
+Of future; in small room large heart enclosed; 
+Pattern of just equality perhaps 
+Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes 
+Of commonalty:  Swarming next appeared 
+The female bee, that feeds her husband drone 
+Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells 
+With honey stored:  The rest are numberless, 
+And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names, 
+Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown 
+The serpent, subtlest beast of all the field, 
+Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes 
+And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee 
+Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. 
+Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled 
+Her motions, as the great first Mover's hand 
+First wheeled their course:  Earth in her rich attire 
+Consummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth, 
+By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked, 
+Frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained: 
+There wanted yet the master-work, the end 
+Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone 
+And brute as other creatures, but endued 
+With sanctity of reason, might erect 
+His stature, and upright with front serene 
+Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence 
+Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven, 
+But grateful to acknowledge whence his good 
+Descends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes 
+Directed in devotion, to adore 
+And worship God Supreme, who made him chief 
+Of all his works:  therefore the Omnipotent 
+Eternal Father (for where is not he 
+Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake. 
+Let us make now Man in our image, Man 
+In our similitude, and let them rule 
+Over the fish and fowl of sea and air, 
+Beast of the field, and over all the Earth, 
+And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. 
+This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man, 
+Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed 
+The breath of life; in his own image he 
+Created thee, in the image of God 
+Express; and thou becamest a living soul. 
+Male he created thee; but thy consort 
+Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said, 
+Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth; 
+Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold 
+Over fish of the sea, and fowl of the air, 
+And every living thing that moves on the Earth. 
+Wherever thus created, for no place 
+Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest, 
+He brought thee into this delicious grove, 
+This garden, planted with the trees of God, 
+Delectable both to behold and taste; 
+And freely all their pleasant fruit for food 
+Gave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields, 
+Variety without end; but of the tree, 
+Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil, 
+Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest; 
+Death is the penalty imposed; beware, 
+And govern well thy appetite; lest Sin 
+Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. 
+Here finished he, and all that he had made 
+Viewed, and behold all was entirely good; 
+So even and morn accomplished the sixth day: 
+Yet not till the Creator from his work 
+Desisting, though unwearied, up returned, 
+Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode; 
+Thence to behold this new created world, 
+The addition of his empire, how it showed 
+In prospect from his throne, how good, how fair, 
+Answering his great idea.  Up he rode 
+Followed with acclamation, and the sound 
+Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned 
+Angelick harmonies:  The earth, the air 
+Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,) 
+The heavens and all the constellations rung, 
+The planets in their station listening stood, 
+While the bright pomp ascended jubilant. 
+Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung, 
+Open, ye Heavens! your living doors;let in 
+The great Creator from his work returned 
+Magnificent, his six days work, a World; 
+Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign 
+To visit oft the dwellings of just men, 
+Delighted; and with frequent intercourse 
+Thither will send his winged messengers 
+On errands of supernal grace.  So sung 
+The glorious train ascending:  He through Heaven, 
+That opened wide her blazing portals, led 
+To God's eternal house direct the way; 
+A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold 
+And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear, 
+Seen in the galaxy, that milky way, 
+Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest 
+Powdered with stars.  And now on Earth the seventh 
+Evening arose in Eden, for the sun 
+Was set, and twilight from the east came on, 
+Forerunning night; when at the holy mount 
+Of Heaven's high-seated top, the imperial throne 
+Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure, 
+The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down 
+With his great Father; for he also went 
+Invisible, yet staid, (such privilege 
+Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained, 
+Author and End of all things; and, from work 
+Now resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day, 
+As resting on that day from all his work, 
+But not in silence holy kept: the harp 
+Had work and rested not; the solemn pipe, 
+And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop, 
+All sounds on fret by string or golden wire, 
+Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice 
+Choral or unison: of incense clouds, 
+Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount. 
+Creation and the six days acts they sung: 
+Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite 
+Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue 
+Relate thee!  Greater now in thy return 
+Than from the giant Angels:  Thee that day 
+Thy thunders magnified; but to create 
+Is greater than created to destroy. 
+Who can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound 
+Thy empire!  Easily the proud attempt 
+Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain, 
+Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought 
+Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw 
+The number of thy worshippers.  Who seeks 
+To lessen thee, against his purpose serves 
+To manifest the more thy might: his evil 
+Thou usest, and from thence createst more good. 
+Witness this new-made world, another Heaven 
+From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view 
+On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea; 
+Of amplitude almost immense, with stars 
+Numerous, and every star perhaps a world 
+Of destined habitation; but thou knowest 
+Their seasons: among these the seat of Men, 
+Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused, 
+Their pleasant dwelling-place.  Thrice happy Men, 
+And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced! 
+Created in his image, there to dwell 
+And worship him; and in reward to rule 
+Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air, 
+And multiply a race of worshippers 
+Holy and just:  Thrice happy, if they know 
+Their happiness, and persevere upright! 
+So sung they, and the empyrean rung 
+With halleluiahs:  Thus was sabbath kept. 
+And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked 
+How first this world and face of things began, 
+And what before thy memory was done 
+From the beginning; that posterity, 
+Informed by thee, might know:  If else thou seekest 
+Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

+ 
+The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear 
+So charming left his voice, that he a while 
+Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear; 
+Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied. 
+What thanks sufficient, or what recompence 
+Equal, have I to render thee, divine 
+Historian, who thus largely hast allayed 
+The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed 
+This friendly condescension to relate 
+Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard 
+With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, 
+With glory attributed to the high 
+Creator!  Something yet of doubt remains, 
+Which only thy solution can resolve. 
+When I behold this goodly frame, this world, 
+Of Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute 
+Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain, 
+An atom, with the firmament compared 
+And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll 
+Spaces incomprehensible, (for such 
+Their distance argues, and their swift return 
+Diurnal,) merely to officiate light 
+Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, 
+One day and night; in all her vast survey 
+Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire, 
+How Nature wise and frugal could commit 
+Such disproportions, with superfluous hand 
+So many nobler bodies to create, 
+Greater so manifold, to this one use, 
+For aught appears, and on their orbs impose 
+Such restless revolution day by day 
+Repeated; while the sedentary Earth, 
+That better might with far less compass move, 
+Served by more noble than herself, attains 
+Her end without least motion, and receives, 
+As tribute, such a sumless journey brought 
+Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; 
+Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails. 
+So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed 
+Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve 
+Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight, 
+With lowliness majestick from her seat, 
+And grace that won who saw to wish her stay, 
+Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers, 
+To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom, 
+Her nursery; they at her coming sprung, 
+And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew. 
+Yet went she not, as not with such discourse 
+Delighted, or not capable her ear 
+Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved, 
+Adam relating, she sole auditress; 
+Her husband the relater she preferred 
+Before the Angel, and of him to ask 
+Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix 
+Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute 
+With conjugal caresses: from his lip 
+Not words alone pleased her.  O! when meet now 
+Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined? 
+With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went, 
+Not unattended; for on her, as Queen, 
+A pomp of winning Graces waited still, 
+And from about her shot darts of desire 
+Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight. 
+And Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed, 
+Benevolent and facile thus replied. 
+To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven 
+Is as the book of God before thee set, 
+Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn 
+His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years: 
+This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth, 
+Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest 
+From Man or Angel the great Architect 
+Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge 
+His secrets to be scanned by them who ought 
+Rather admire; or, if they list to try 
+Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens 
+Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move 
+His laughter at their quaint opinions wide 
+Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven 
+And calculate the stars, how they will wield 
+The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive 
+To save appearances; how gird the sphere 
+With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er, 
+Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb: 
+Already by thy reasoning this I guess, 
+Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest 
+That bodies bright and greater should not serve 
+The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run, 
+Earth sitting still, when she alone receives 
+The benefit:  Consider first, that great 
+Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth 
+Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small, 
+Nor glistering, may of solid good contain 
+More plenty than the sun that barren shines; 
+Whose virtue on itself works no effect, 
+But in the fruitful Earth; there first received, 
+His beams, unactive else, their vigour find. 
+Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries 
+Officious; but to thee, Earth's habitant. 
+And for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak 
+The Maker's high magnificence, who built 
+So spacious, and his line stretched out so far; 
+That Man may know he dwells not in his own; 
+An edifice too large for him to fill, 
+Lodged in a small partition; and the rest 
+Ordained for uses to his Lord best known. 
+The swiftness of those circles attribute, 
+Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, 
+That to corporeal substances could add 
+Speed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow, 
+Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven 
+Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived 
+In Eden; distance inexpressible 
+By numbers that have name.  But this I urge, 
+Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show 
+Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved; 
+Not that I so affirm, though so it seem 
+To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. 
+God, to remove his ways from human sense, 
+Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight, 
+If it presume, might err in things too high, 
+And no advantage gain.  What if the sun 
+Be center to the world; and other stars, 
+By his attractive virtue and their own 
+Incited, dance about him various rounds? 
+Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid, 
+Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, 
+In six thou seest; and what if seventh to these 
+The planet earth, so stedfast though she seem, 
+Insensibly three different motions move? 
+Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe, 
+Moved contrary with thwart obliquities; 
+Or save the sun his labour, and that swift 
+Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed, 
+Invisible else above all stars, the wheel 
+Of day and night; which needs not thy belief, 
+If earth, industrious of herself, fetch day 
+Travelling east, and with her part averse 
+From the sun's beam meet night, her other part 
+Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light, 
+Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air, 
+To the terrestrial moon be as a star, 
+Enlightening her by day, as she by night 
+This earth? reciprocal, if land be there, 
+Fields and inhabitants:  Her spots thou seest 
+As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce 
+Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat 
+Allotted there; and other suns perhaps, 
+With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry, 
+Communicating male and female light; 
+Which two great sexes animate the world, 
+Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live. 
+For such vast room in Nature unpossessed 
+By living soul, desart and desolate, 
+Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute 
+Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far 
+Down to this habitable, which returns 
+Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. 
+But whether thus these things, or whether not; 
+But whether the sun, predominant in Heaven, 
+Rise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun; 
+He from the east his flaming road begin; 
+Or she from west her silent course advance, 
+With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps 
+On her soft axle, while she paces even, 
+And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along; 
+Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid; 
+Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear! 
+Of other creatures, as him pleases best, 
+Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou 
+In what he gives to thee, this Paradise 
+And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high 
+To know what passes there; be lowly wise: 
+Think only what concerns thee, and thy being; 
+Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there 
+Live, in what state, condition, or degree; 
+Contented that thus far hath been revealed 
+Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven. 
+To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied. 
+How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure 
+Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene! 
+And, freed from intricacies, taught to live 
+The easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts 
+To interrupt the sweet of life, from which 
+God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares, 
+And not molest us; unless we ourselves 
+Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain. 
+But apt the mind or fancy is to rove 
+Unchecked, and of her roving is no end; 
+Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn, 
+That, not to know at large of things remote 
+From use, obscure and subtle; but, to know 
+That which before us lies in daily life, 
+Is the prime wisdom:  What is more, is fume, 
+Or emptiness, or fond impertinence: 
+And renders us, in things that most concern, 
+Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek. 
+Therefore from this high pitch let us descend 
+A lower flight, and speak of things at hand 
+Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise 
+Of something not unseasonable to ask, 
+By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned. 
+Thee I have heard relating what was done 
+Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate 
+My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard; 
+And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest 
+How subtly to detain thee I devise; 
+Inviting thee to hear while I relate; 
+Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply: 
+For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven; 
+And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear 
+Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst 
+And hunger both, from labour, at the hour 
+Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, 
+Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine 
+Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety. 
+To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek. 
+Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, 
+Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee 
+Abundantly his gifts hath also poured 
+Inward and outward both, his image fair: 
+Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace 
+Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms; 
+Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth 
+Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire 
+Gladly into the ways of God with Man: 
+For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set 
+On Man his equal love:  Say therefore on; 
+For I that day was absent, as befel, 
+Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, 
+Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell; 
+Squared in full legion (such command we had) 
+To see that none thence issued forth a spy, 
+Or enemy, while God was in his work; 
+Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold, 
+Destruction with creation might have mixed. 
+Not that they durst without his leave attempt; 
+But us he sends upon his high behests 
+For state, as Sovran King; and to inure 
+Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut, 
+The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong; 
+But long ere our approaching heard within 
+Noise, other than the sound of dance or song, 
+Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage. 
+Glad we returned up to the coasts of light 
+Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge. 
+But thy relation now; for I attend, 
+Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine. 
+So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. 
+For Man to tell how human life began 
+Is hard; for who himself beginning knew 
+Desire with thee still longer to converse 
+Induced me.  As new waked from soundest sleep, 
+Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid, 
+In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun 
+Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed. 
+Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned, 
+And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised 
+By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung, 
+As thitherward endeavouring, and upright 
+Stood on my feet: about me round I saw 
+Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains, 
+And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these, 
+Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew; 
+Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled; 
+With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed. 
+Myself I then perused, and limb by limb 
+Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran 
+With supple joints, as lively vigour led: 
+But who I was, or where, or from what cause, 
+Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake; 
+My tongue obeyed, and readily could name 
+Whate'er I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, fair light, 
+And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay, 
+Ye Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains, 
+And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, 
+Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?-- 
+Not of myself;--by some great Maker then, 
+In goodness and in power pre-eminent: 
+Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, 
+From whom I have that thus I move and live, 
+And feel that I am happier than I know.-- 
+While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither, 
+From where I first drew air, and first beheld 
+This happy light; when, answer none returned, 
+On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers, 
+Pensive I sat me down:  There gentle sleep 
+First found me, and with soft oppression seised 
+My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought 
+I then was passing to my former state 
+Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: 
+When suddenly stood at my head a dream, 
+Whose inward apparition gently moved 
+My fancy to believe I yet had being, 
+And lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine, 
+And said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise, 
+'First Man, of men innumerable ordained 
+'First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide 
+'To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.' 
+So saying, by the hand he took me raised, 
+And over fields and waters, as in air 
+Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up 
+A woody mountain; whose high top was plain, 
+A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees 
+Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw 
+Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.  Each tree, 
+Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye 
+Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite 
+To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found 
+Before mine eyes all real, as the dream 
+Had lively shadowed:  Here had new begun 
+My wandering, had not he, who was my guide 
+Up hither, from among the trees appeared, 
+Presence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe, 
+In adoration at his feet I fell 
+Submiss:  He reared me, and 'Whom thou soughtest I am,' 
+Said mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest 
+'Above, or round about thee, or beneath. 
+'This Paradise I give thee, count it thine 
+'To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat: 
+'Of every tree that in the garden grows 
+'Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: 
+'But of the tree whose operation brings 
+'Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set 
+'The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith, 
+'Amid the garden by the tree of life, 
+'Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste, 
+'And shun the bitter consequence: for know, 
+'The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command 
+'Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die, 
+'From that day mortal; and this happy state 
+'Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world 
+'Of woe and sorrow.'  Sternly he pronounced 
+The rigid interdiction, which resounds 
+Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice 
+Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect 
+Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed. 
+'Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth 
+'To thee and to thy race I give; as lords 
+'Possess it, and all things that therein live, 
+'Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl. 
+'In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold 
+'After their kinds; I bring them to receive 
+'From thee their names, and pay thee fealty 
+'With low subjection; understand the same 
+'Of fish within their watery residence, 
+'Not hither summoned, since they cannot change 
+'Their element, to draw the thinner air.' 
+As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold 
+Approaching two and two; these cowering low 
+With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing. 
+I named them, as they passed, and understood 
+Their nature, with such knowledge God endued 
+My sudden apprehension:  But in these 
+I found not what methought I wanted still; 
+And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed. 
+O, by what name, for thou above all these, 
+Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher, 
+Surpassest far my naming; how may I 
+Adore thee, Author of this universe, 
+And all this good to man? for whose well being 
+So amply, and with hands so liberal, 
+Thou hast provided all things:  But with me 
+I see not who partakes.  In solitude 
+What happiness, who can enjoy alone, 
+Or, all enjoying, what contentment find? 
+Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright, 
+As with a smile more brightened, thus replied. 
+What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth 
+With various living creatures, and the air 
+Replenished, and all these at thy command 
+To come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not 
+Their language and their ways?  They also know, 
+And reason not contemptibly:  With these 
+Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large. 
+So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed 
+So ordering:  I, with leave of speech implored, 
+And humble deprecation, thus replied. 
+Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power; 
+My Maker, be propitious while I speak. 
+Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, 
+And these inferiour far beneath me set? 
+Among unequals what society 
+Can sort, what harmony, or true delight? 
+Which must be mutual, in proportion due 
+Given and received; but, in disparity 
+The one intense, the other still remiss, 
+Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove 
+Tedious alike:  Of fellowship I speak 
+Such as I seek, fit to participate 
+All rational delight: wherein the brute 
+Cannot be human consort:  They rejoice 
+Each with their kind, lion with lioness; 
+So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined: 
+Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl 
+So well converse, nor with the ox the ape; 
+Worse then can man with beast, and least of all. 
+Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased. 
+A nice and subtle happiness, I see, 
+Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice 
+Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste 
+No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary. 
+What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state? 
+Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed 
+Of happiness, or not? who am alone 
+From all eternity; for none I know 
+Second to me or like, equal much less. 
+How have I then with whom to hold converse, 
+Save with the creatures which I made, and those 
+To me inferiour, infinite descents 
+Beneath what other creatures are to thee? 
+He ceased; I lowly answered.  To attain 
+The highth and depth of thy eternal ways 
+All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things! 
+Thou in thyself art perfect, and in thee 
+Is no deficience found:  Not so is Man, 
+But in degree; the cause of his desire 
+By conversation with his like to help 
+Or solace his defects.  No need that thou 
+Shouldst propagate, already Infinite; 
+And through all numbers absolute, though One: 
+But Man by number is to manifest 
+His single imperfection, and beget 
+Like of his like, his image multiplied, 
+In unity defective; which requires 
+Collateral love, and dearest amity. 
+Thou in thy secresy although alone, 
+Best with thyself accompanied, seekest not 
+Social communication; yet, so pleased, 
+Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt 
+Of union or communion, deified: 
+I, by conversing, cannot these erect 
+From prone; nor in their ways complacence find. 
+Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used 
+Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained 
+This answer from the gracious Voice Divine. 
+Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased; 
+And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone, 
+Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself; 
+Expressing well the spirit within thee free, 
+My image, not imparted to the brute; 
+Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee 
+Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike; 
+And be so minded still:  I, ere thou spakest, 
+Knew it not good for Man to be alone; 
+And no such company as then thou sawest 
+Intended thee; for trial only brought, 
+To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet: 
+What next I bring shall please thee, be assured, 
+Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, 
+Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire. 
+He ended, or I heard no more; for now 
+My earthly by his heavenly overpowered, 
+Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth 
+In that celestial colloquy sublime, 
+As with an object that excels the sense 
+Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair 
+Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called 
+By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes. 
+Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell 
+Of fancy, my internal sight; by which, 
+Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw, 
+Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape 
+Still glorious before whom awake I stood: 
+Who stooping opened my left side, and took 
+From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm, 
+And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, 
+But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed: 
+The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands; 
+Under his forming hands a creature grew, 
+Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair, 
+That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now 
+Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained 
+And in her looks; which from that time infused 
+Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, 
+And into all things from her air inspired 
+The spirit of love and amorous delight. 
+She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked 
+To find her, or for ever to deplore 
+Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: 
+When out of hope, behold her, not far off, 
+Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned 
+With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow 
+To make her amiable:  On she came, 
+Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen, 
+And guided by his voice; nor uninformed 
+Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites: 
+Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, 
+In every gesture dignity and love. 
+I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud. 
+This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled 
+Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign, 
+Giver of all things fair! but fairest this 
+Of all thy gifts! nor enviest.  I now see 
+Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself 
+Before me:  Woman is her name;of Man 
+Extracted: for this cause he shall forego 
+Father and mother, and to his wife adhere; 
+And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul. 
+She heard me thus; and though divinely brought, 
+Yet innocence, and virgin modesty, 
+Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth, 
+That would be wooed, and not unsought be won, 
+Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired, 
+The more desirable; or, to say all, 
+Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought, 
+Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned: 
+I followed her; she what was honour knew, 
+And with obsequious majesty approved 
+My pleaded reason.  To the nuptial bower 
+I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven, 
+And happy constellations, on that hour 
+Shed their selectest influence; the Earth 
+Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill; 
+Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs 
+Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings 
+Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub, 
+Disporting, till the amorous bird of night 
+Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star 
+On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp. 
+Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought 
+My story to the sum of earthly bliss, 
+Which I enjoy; and must confess to find 
+In all things else delight indeed, but such 
+As, used or not, works in the mind no change, 
+Nor vehement desire; these delicacies 
+I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers, 
+Walks, and the melody of birds: but here 
+Far otherwise, transported I behold, 
+Transported touch; here passion first I felt, 
+Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else 
+Superiour and unmoved; here only weak 
+Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance. 
+Or Nature failed in me, and left some part 
+Not proof enough such object to sustain; 
+Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps 
+More than enough; at least on her bestowed 
+Too much of ornament, in outward show 
+Elaborate, of inward less exact. 
+For well I understand in the prime end 
+Of Nature her the inferiour, in the mind 
+And inward faculties, which most excel; 
+In outward also her resembling less 
+His image who made both, and less expressing 
+The character of that dominion given 
+O'er other creatures:  Yet when I approach 
+Her loveliness, so absolute she seems 
+And in herself complete, so well to know 
+Her own, that what she wills to do or say, 
+Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best: 
+All higher knowledge in her presence falls 
+Degraded;  Wisdom in discourse with her 
+Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows; 
+Authority and Reason on her wait, 
+As one intended first, not after made 
+Occasionally; and, to consummate all, 
+Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat 
+Build in her loveliest, and create an awe 
+About her, as a guard angelick placed. 
+To whom the Angel with contracted brow. 
+Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part; 
+Do thou but thine; and be not diffident 
+Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou 
+Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh, 
+By attributing overmuch to things 
+Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest. 
+For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so, 
+An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well 
+Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love; 
+Not thy subjection:  Weigh with her thyself; 
+Then value:  Oft-times nothing profits more 
+Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right 
+Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest, 
+The more she will acknowledge thee her head, 
+And to realities yield all her shows: 
+Made so adorn for thy delight the more, 
+So awful, that with honour thou mayest love 
+Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. 
+But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind 
+Is propagated, seem such dear delight 
+Beyond all other; think the same vouchsafed 
+To cattle and each beast; which would not be 
+To them made common and divulged, if aught 
+Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue 
+The soul of man, or passion in him move. 
+What higher in her society thou findest 
+Attractive, human, rational, love still; 
+In loving thou dost well, in passion not, 
+Wherein true love consists not:  Love refines 
+The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat 
+In reason, and is judicious; is the scale 
+By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend, 
+Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause, 
+Among the beasts no mate for thee was found. 
+To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied. 
+Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught 
+In procreation common to all kinds, 
+(Though higher of the genial bed by far, 
+And with mysterious reverence I deem,) 
+So much delights me, as those graceful acts, 
+Those thousand decencies, that daily flow 
+From all her words and actions mixed with love 
+And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned 
+Union of mind, or in us both one soul; 
+Harmony to behold in wedded pair 
+More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear. 
+Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose 
+What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled, 
+Who meet with various objects, from the sense 
+Variously representing; yet, still free, 
+Approve the best, and follow what I approve. 
+To love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest, 
+Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide; 
+Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask: 
+Love not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love 
+Express they? by looks only? or do they mix 
+Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? 
+To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed 
+Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue, 
+Answered.  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest 
+Us happy, and without love no happiness. 
+Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest, 
+(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy 
+In eminence; and obstacle find none 
+Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars; 
+Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace, 
+Total they mix, union of pure with pure 
+Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need, 
+As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul. 
+But I can now no more; the parting sun 
+Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles 
+Hesperian sets, my signal to depart. 
+Be strong, live happy, and love!  But, first of all, 
+Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep 
+His great command; take heed lest passion sway 
+Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will 
+Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons, 
+The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware! 
+I in thy persevering shall rejoice, 
+And all the Blest:  Stand fast;to stand or fall 
+Free in thine own arbitrement it lies. 
+Perfect within, no outward aid require; 
+And all temptation to transgress repel. 
+So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus 
+Followed with benediction.  Since to part, 
+Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger, 
+Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore! 
+Gentle to me and affable hath been 
+Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever 
+With grateful memory:  Thou to mankind 
+Be good and friendly still, and oft return! 
+So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven 
+From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.

+ 
+No more of talk where God or Angel guest 
+With Man, as with his friend, familiar us'd, 
+To sit indulgent, and with him partake 
+Rural repast; permitting him the while 
+Venial discourse unblam'd. I now must change 
+Those notes to tragick; foul distrust, and breach 
+Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt, 
+And disobedience: on the part of Heaven 
+Now alienated, distance and distaste, 
+Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given, 
+That brought into this world a world of woe, 
+Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery 
+Death's harbinger: Sad talk!yet argument 
+Not less but more heroick than the wrath 
+Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued

+Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd;

+If answerable style I can obtain 
+Of my celestial patroness, who deigns 
+Her nightly visitation unimplor'd, 
+And dictates to me slumbering; or inspires 
+Easy my unpremeditated verse: 
+Since first this subject for heroick song 
+Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late; 
+Not sedulous by nature to indite 
+Wars, hitherto the only argument 
+Heroick deem'd chief mastery to dissect 
+With long and tedious havock fabled knights 
+In battles feign'd; the better fortitude 
+Of patience and heroick martyrdom 
+Unsung; or to describe races and games, 
+Or tilting furniture, imblazon'd shields, 
+Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds, 
+Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights 
+At joust and tournament; then marshall'd feast 
+Serv'd up in hall with sewers and seneshals; 
+The skill of artifice or office mean, 
+Not that which justly gives heroick name 
+To person, or to poem.  Me, of these 
+Nor skill'd nor studious, higher argument 
+Remains; sufficient of itself to raise 
+That name, unless an age too late, or cold 
+Climate, or years, damp my intended wing 
+Depress'd; and much they may, if all be mine, 
+Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear. 
+The sun was sunk, and after him the star 
+Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring 
+Twilight upon the earth, short arbiter 
+"twixt day and night, and now from end to end 
+Night's hemisphere had veil'd the horizon round: 
+When satan, who late fled before the threats 
+Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd 
+In meditated fraud and malice, bent 
+On Man's destruction, maugre what might hap 
+Of heavier on himself, fearless returned 
+From compassing the earth; cautious of day, 
+Since Uriel, regent of the sun, descried 
+His entrance, and foreworned the Cherubim 
+That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven, 
+The space of seven continued nights he rode 
+With darkness; thrice the equinoctial line 
+He circled; four times crossed the car of night 
+From pole to pole, traversing each colure; 
+On the eighth returned; and, on the coast averse 
+From entrance or Cherubick watch, by stealth 
+Found unsuspected way.  There was a place, 
+Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change, 
+Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise, 
+Into a gulf shot under ground, till part 
+Rose up a fountain by the tree of life: 
+In with the river sunk, and with it rose 
+Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought 
+Where to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land, 
+From Eden over Pontus and the pool 
+Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob; 
+Downward as far antarctick; and in length, 
+West from Orontes to the ocean barred 
+At Darien ; thence to the land where flows 
+Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roamed 
+With narrow search; and with inspection deep 
+Considered every creature, which of all 
+Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found 
+The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field. 
+Him after long debate, irresolute 
+Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose 
+Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom 
+To enter, and his dark suggestions hide 
+From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake 
+Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark, 
+As from his wit and native subtlety 
+Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed, 
+Doubt might beget of diabolick power 
+Active within, beyond the sense of brute. 
+Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief 
+His bursting passion into plaints thus poured. 
+More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built 
+With second thoughts, reforming what was old! 
+O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred 
+For what God, after better, worse would build? 
+Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens 
+That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps, 
+Light above light, for thee alone, as seems, 
+In thee concentring all their precious beams 
+Of sacred influence!  As God in Heaven 
+Is center, yet extends to all; so thou, 
+Centring, receivest from all those orbs: in thee, 
+Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears 
+Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth 
+Of creatures animate with gradual life 
+Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man. 
+With what delight could I have walked thee round, 
+If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange 
+Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains, 
+Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned, 
+Rocks, dens, and caves!  But I in none of these 
+Find place or refuge; and the more I see 
+Pleasures about me, so much more I feel 
+Torment within me, as from the hateful siege 
+Of contraries: all good to me becomes 
+Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state. 
+But neither here seek I, no nor in Heaven 
+To dwell, unless by mastering Heaven's Supreme; 
+Nor hope to be myself less miserable 
+By what I seek, but others to make such 
+As I, though thereby worse to me redound: 
+For only in destroying I find ease 
+To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed, 
+Or won to what may work his utter loss, 
+For whom all this was made, all this will soon 
+Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe; 
+In woe then; that destruction wide may range: 
+To me shall be the glory sole among 
+The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred 
+What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days 
+Continued making; and who knows how long 
+Before had been contriving? though perhaps 
+Not longer than since I, in one night, freed 
+From servitude inglorious well nigh half 
+The angelick name, and thinner left the throng 
+Of his adorers: He, to be avenged, 
+And to repair his numbers thus impaired, 
+Whether such virtue spent of old now failed 
+More Angels to create, if they at least 
+Are his created, or, to spite us more, 
+Determined to advance into our room 
+A creature formed of earth, and him endow, 
+Exalted from so base original, 
+With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed, 
+He effected; Man he made, and for him built 
+Magnificent this world, and earth his seat, 
+Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity! 
+Subjected to his service angel-wings, 
+And flaming ministers to watch and tend 
+Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance 
+I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist 
+Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry 
+In every bush and brake, where hap may find 
+The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds 
+To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. 
+O foul descent! that I, who erst contended 
+With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained 
+Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime, 
+This essence to incarnate and imbrute, 
+That to the highth of Deity aspired! 
+But what will not ambition and revenge 
+Descend to?  Who aspires, must down as low 
+As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last, 
+To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet, 
+Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils: 
+Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed, 
+Since higher I fall short, on him who next 
+Provokes my envy, this new favourite 
+Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite, 
+Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised 
+From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid. 
+So saying, through each thicket dank or dry, 
+Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on 
+His midnight-search, where soonest he might find 
+The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found 
+In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled, 
+His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles: 
+Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den, 
+Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb, 
+Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth 
+The Devil entered; and his brutal sense, 
+In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired 
+With act intelligential; but his sleep 
+Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn. 
+Now, when as sacred light began to dawn 
+In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed 
+Their morning incense, when all things, that breathe, 
+From the Earth's great altar send up silent praise 
+To the Creator, and his nostrils fill 
+With grateful smell, forth came the human pair, 
+And joined their vocal worship to the quire 
+Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake 
+The season prime for sweetest scents and airs: 
+Then commune, how that day they best may ply 
+Their growing work: for much their work out-grew 
+The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide, 
+And Eve first to her husband thus began. 
+Adam, well may we labour still to dress 
+This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower, 
+Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands 
+Aid us, the work under our labour grows, 
+Luxurious by restraint; what we by day 
+Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, 
+One night or two with wanton growth derides 
+Tending to wild.  Thou therefore now advise, 
+Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present: 
+Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice 
+Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind 
+The woodbine round this arbour, or direct 
+The clasping ivy where to climb; while I, 
+In yonder spring of roses intermixed 
+With myrtle, find what to redress till noon: 
+For, while so near each other thus all day 
+Our task we choose, what wonder if so near 
+Looks intervene and smiles, or object new 
+Casual discourse draw on; which intermits 
+Our day's work, brought to little, though begun 
+Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned? 
+To whom mild answer Adam thus returned. 
+Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond 
+Compare above all living creatures dear! 
+Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed, 
+How we might best fulfil the work which here 
+God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass 
+Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found 
+In woman, than to study houshold good, 
+And good works in her husband to promote. 
+Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed 
+Labour, as to debar us when we need 
+Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, 
+Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse 
+Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow, 
+To brute denied, and are of love the food; 
+Love, not the lowest end of human life. 
+For not to irksome toil, but to delight, 
+He made us, and delight to reason joined. 
+These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands 
+Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide 
+As we need walk, till younger hands ere long 
+Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps 
+Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield: 
+For solitude sometimes is best society, 
+And short retirement urges sweet return. 
+But other doubt possesses me, lest harm 
+Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest 
+What hath been warned us, what malicious foe 
+Envying our happiness, and of his own 
+Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame 
+By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand 
+Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find 
+His wish and best advantage, us asunder; 
+Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each 
+To other speedy aid might lend at need: 
+Whether his first design be to withdraw 
+Our fealty from God, or to disturb 
+Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss 
+Enjoyed by us excites his envy more; 
+Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side 
+That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects. 
+The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, 
+Safest and seemliest by her husband stays, 
+Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. 
+To whom the virgin majesty of Eve, 
+As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, 
+With sweet austere composure thus replied. 
+Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth's Lord! 
+That such an enemy we have, who seeks 
+Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn, 
+And from the parting Angel over-heard, 
+As in a shady nook I stood behind, 
+Just then returned at shut of evening flowers. 
+But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt 
+To God or thee, because we have a foe 
+May tempt it, I expected not to hear. 
+His violence thou fearest not, being such 
+As we, not capable of death or pain, 
+Can either not receive, or can repel. 
+His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers 
+Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love 
+Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced; 
+Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast, 
+Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear? 
+To whom with healing words Adam replied. 
+Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve! 
+For such thou art; from sin and blame entire: 
+Not diffident of thee do I dissuade 
+Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid 
+The attempt itself, intended by our foe. 
+For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses 
+The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed 
+Not incorruptible of faith, not proof 
+Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn 
+And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong, 
+Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, 
+If such affront I labour to avert 
+From thee alone, which on us both at once 
+The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare; 
+Or daring, first on me the assault shall light. 
+Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; 
+Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce 
+Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid. 
+I, from the influence of thy looks, receive 
+Access in every virtue; in thy sight 
+More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were 
+Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, 
+Shame to be overcome or over-reached, 
+Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite. 
+Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel 
+When I am present, and thy trial choose 
+With me, best witness of thy virtue tried? 
+So spake domestick Adam in his care 
+And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought 
+Less attributed to her faith sincere, 
+Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed. 
+If this be our condition, thus to dwell 
+In narrow circuit straitened by a foe, 
+Subtle or violent, we not endued 
+Single with like defence, wherever met; 
+How are we happy, still in fear of harm? 
+But harm precedes not sin: only our foe, 
+Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem 
+Of our integrity: his foul esteem 
+Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns 
+Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared 
+By us? who rather double honour gain 
+From his surmise proved false; find peace within, 
+Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event. 
+And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed 
+Alone, without exteriour help sustained? 
+Let us not then suspect our happy state 
+Left so imperfect by the Maker wise, 
+As not secure to single or combined. 
+Frail is our happiness, if this be so, 
+And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed. 
+To whom thus Adam fervently replied. 
+O Woman, best are all things as the will 
+Of God ordained them: His creating hand 
+Nothing imperfect or deficient left 
+Of all that he created, much less Man, 
+Or aught that might his happy state secure, 
+Secure from outward force; within himself 
+The danger lies, yet lies within his power: 
+Against his will he can receive no harm. 
+But God left free the will; for what obeys 
+Reason, is free; and Reason he made right, 
+But bid her well be ware, and still erect; 
+Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised, 
+She dictate false; and mis-inform the will 
+To do what God expressly hath forbid. 
+Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins, 
+That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me. 
+Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve; 
+Since Reason not impossibly may meet 
+Some specious object by the foe suborned, 
+And fall into deception unaware, 
+Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned. 
+Seek not temptation then, which to avoid 
+Were better, and most likely if from me 
+Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought. 
+Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve 
+First thy obedience; the other who can know, 
+Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? 
+But, if thou think, trial unsought may find 
+Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest, 
+Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; 
+Go in thy native innocence, rely 
+On what thou hast of virtue; summon all! 
+For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. 
+So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve 
+Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied. 
+With thy permission then, and thus forewarned 
+Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words 
+Touched only; that our trial, when least sought, 
+May find us both perhaps far less prepared, 
+The willinger I go, nor much expect 
+A foe so proud will first the weaker seek; 
+So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. 
+Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand 
+Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light, 
+Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train, 
+Betook her to the groves; but Delia's self 
+In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport, 
+Though not as she with bow and quiver armed, 
+But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude, 
+Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought. 
+To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned, 
+Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled 
+Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime, 
+Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove. 
+Her long with ardent look his eye pursued 
+Delighted, but desiring more her stay. 
+Oft he to her his charge of quick return 
+Repeated; she to him as oft engaged 
+To be returned by noon amid the bower, 
+And all things in best order to invite 
+Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose. 
+O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve, 
+Of thy presumed return! event perverse! 
+Thou never from that hour in Paradise 
+Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose; 
+Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades, 
+Waited with hellish rancour imminent 
+To intercept thy way, or send thee back 
+Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss! 
+For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend, 
+Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come; 
+And on his quest, where likeliest he might find 
+The only two of mankind, but in them 
+The whole included race, his purposed prey. 
+In bower and field he sought, where any tuft 
+Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay, 
+Their tendance, or plantation for delight; 
+By fountain or by shady rivulet 
+He sought them both, but wished his hap might find 
+Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope 
+Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish, 
+Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, 
+Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood, 
+Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round 
+About her glowed, oft stooping to support 
+Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay 
+Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold, 
+Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays 
+Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while 
+Herself, though fairest unsupported flower, 
+From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh. 
+Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed 
+Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm; 
+Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen, 
+Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers 
+Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve: 
+Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned 
+Or of revived Adonis, or renowned 
+Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son; 
+Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king 
+Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse. 
+Much he the place admired, the person more. 
+As one who long in populous city pent, 
+Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air, 
+Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe 
+Among the pleasant villages and farms 
+Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight; 
+The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine, 
+Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound; 
+If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass, 
+What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more; 
+She most, and in her look sums all delight: 
+Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold 
+This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve 
+Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form 
+Angelick, but more soft, and feminine, 
+Her graceful innocence, her every air 
+Of gesture, or least action, overawed 
+His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved 
+His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: 
+That space the Evil-one abstracted stood 
+From his own evil, and for the time remained 
+Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed, 
+Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge: 
+But the hot Hell that always in him burns, 
+Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight, 
+And tortures him now more, the more he sees 
+Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon 
+Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts 
+Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. 
+Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet 
+Compulsion thus transported, to forget 
+What hither brought us! hate, not love;nor hope 
+Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste 
+Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy, 
+Save what is in destroying; other joy 
+To me is lost.  Then, let me not let pass 
+Occasion which now smiles; behold alone 
+The woman, opportune to all attempts, 
+Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh, 
+Whose higher intellectual more I shun, 
+And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb 
+Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould; 
+Foe not informidable! exempt from wound, 
+I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain 
+Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven. 
+She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods! 
+Not terrible, though terrour be in love 
+And beauty, not approached by stronger hate, 
+Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned; 
+The way which to her ruin now I tend. 
+So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed 
+In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve 
+Addressed his way: not with indented wave, 
+Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear, 
+Circular base of rising folds, that towered 
+Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head 
+Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes; 
+With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect 
+Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass 
+Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape 
+And lovely; never since of serpent-kind 
+Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed, 
+Hermione and Cadmus, or the god 
+In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed 
+Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen; 
+He with Olympias; this with her who bore 
+Scipio, the highth of Rome.  With tract oblique 
+At first, as one who sought access, but feared 
+To interrupt, side-long he works his way. 
+As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought 
+Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind 
+Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail: 
+So varied he, and of his tortuous train 
+Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, 
+To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound 
+Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used 
+To such disport before her through the field, 
+From every beast; more duteous at her call, 
+Than at Circean call the herd disguised. 
+He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood, 
+But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed 
+His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck, 
+Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod. 
+His gentle dumb expression turned at length 
+The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad 
+Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue 
+Organick, or impulse of vocal air, 
+His fraudulent temptation thus began. 
+Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps 
+Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm 
+Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain, 
+Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze 
+Insatiate; I thus single;nor have feared 
+Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired. 
+Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair, 
+Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine 
+By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore 
+With ravishment beheld! there best beheld, 
+Where universally admired; but here 
+In this enclosure wild, these beasts among, 
+Beholders rude, and shallow to discern 
+Half what in thee is fair, one man except, 
+Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen 
+A Goddess among Gods, adored and served 
+By Angels numberless, thy daily train. 
+So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned: 
+Into the heart of Eve his words made way, 
+Though at the voice much marvelling; at length, 
+Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake. 
+What may this mean? language of man pronounced 
+By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed? 
+The first, at least, of these I thought denied 
+To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day, 
+Created mute to all articulate sound: 
+The latter I demur; for in their looks 
+Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears. 
+Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field 
+I knew, but not with human voice endued; 
+Redouble then this miracle, and say, 
+How camest thou speakable of mute, and how 
+To me so friendly grown above the rest 
+Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? 
+Say, for such wonder claims attention due. 
+To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied. 
+Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve! 
+Easy to me it is to tell thee all 
+What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed: 
+I was at first as other beasts that graze 
+The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low, 
+As was my food; nor aught but food discerned 
+Or sex, and apprehended nothing high: 
+Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced 
+A goodly tree far distant to behold 
+Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed, 
+Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze; 
+When from the boughs a savoury odour blown, 
+Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense 
+Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats 
+Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even, 
+Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play. 
+To satisfy the sharp desire I had 
+Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved 
+Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once, 
+Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent 
+Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen. 
+About the mossy trunk I wound me soon; 
+For, high from ground, the branches would require 
+Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree 
+All other beasts that saw, with like desire 
+Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. 
+Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung 
+Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill 
+I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour, 
+At feed or fountain, never had I found. 
+Sated at length, ere long I might perceive 
+Strange alteration in me, to degree 
+Of reason in my inward powers; and speech 
+Wanted not long; though to this shape retained. 
+Thenceforth to speculations high or deep 
+I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind 
+Considered all things visible in Heaven, 
+Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good: 
+But all that fair and good in thy divine 
+Semblance, and in thy beauty's heavenly ray, 
+United I beheld; no fair to thine 
+Equivalent or second! which compelled 
+Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come 
+And gaze, and worship thee of right declared 
+Sovran of creatures, universal Dame! 
+So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve, 
+Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied. 
+Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt 
+The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved: 
+But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far? 
+For many are the trees of God that grow 
+In Paradise, and various, yet unknown 
+To us; in such abundance lies our choice, 
+As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched, 
+Still hanging incorruptible, till men 
+Grow up to their provision, and more hands 
+Help to disburden Nature of her birth. 
+To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad. 
+Empress, the way is ready, and not long; 
+Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat, 
+Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past 
+Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept 
+My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon 
+Lead then, said Eve.  He, leading, swiftly rolled 
+In tangles, and made intricate seem straight, 
+To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy 
+Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire, 
+Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night 
+Condenses, and the cold environs round, 
+Kindled through agitation to a flame, 
+Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, 
+Hovering and blazing with delusive light, 
+Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way 
+To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool; 
+There swallowed up and lost, from succour far. 
+So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud 
+Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree 
+Of prohibition, root of all our woe; 
+Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. 
+Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither, 
+Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess, 
+The credit of whose virtue rest with thee; 
+Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects. 
+But of this tree we may not taste nor touch; 
+God so commanded, and left that command 
+Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live 
+Law to ourselves; our reason is our law. 
+To whom the Tempter guilefully replied. 
+Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit 
+Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat, 
+Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air$? 
+To whom thus Eve, yet sinless.  Of the fruit 
+Of each tree in the garden we may eat; 
+But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst 
+The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat 
+Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 
+She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold 
+The Tempter, but with show of zeal and love 
+To Man, and indignation at his wrong, 
+New part puts on; and, as to passion moved, 
+Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act 
+Raised, as of some great matter to begin. 
+As when of old some orator renowned, 
+In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence 
+Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed, 
+Stood in himself collected; while each part, 
+Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue; 
+Sometimes in highth began, as no delay 
+Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right: 
+So standing, moving, or to highth up grown, 
+The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began. 
+O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant, 
+Mother of science! now I feel thy power 
+Within me clear; not only to discern 
+Things in their causes, but to trace the ways 
+Of highest agents, deemed however wise. 
+Queen of this universe! do not believe 
+Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die: 
+How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life 
+To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me, 
+Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live, 
+And life more perfect have attained than Fate 
+Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot. 
+Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast 
+Is open? or will God incense his ire 
+For such a petty trespass? and not praise 
+Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain 
+Of death denounced, whatever thing death be, 
+Deterred not from achieving what might lead 
+To happier life, knowledge of good and evil; 
+Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil 
+Be real, why not known, since easier shunned? 
+God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; 
+Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed: 
+Your fear itself of death removes the fear. 
+Why then was this forbid?  Why, but to awe; 
+Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant, 
+His worshippers?  He knows that in the day 
+Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear, 
+Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then 
+Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods, 
+Knowing both good and evil, as they know. 
+That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man, 
+Internal Man, is but proportion meet; 
+I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods. 
+So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off 
+Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished, 
+Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring. 
+And what are Gods, that Man may not become 
+As they, participating God-like food? 
+The Gods are first, and that advantage use 
+On our belief, that all from them proceeds: 
+I question it; for this fair earth I see, 
+Warmed by the sun, producing every kind; 
+Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed 
+Knowledge of good and evil in this tree, 
+That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains 
+Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies 
+The offence, that Man should thus attain to know? 
+What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree 
+Impart against his will, if all be his? 
+Or is it envy? and can envy dwell 
+In heavenly breasts?  These, these, and many more 
+Causes import your need of this fair fruit. 
+Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste! 
+He ended; and his words, replete with guile, 
+Into her heart too easy entrance won: 
+Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold 
+Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound 
+Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned 
+With reason, to her seeming, and with truth: 
+Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked 
+An eager appetite, raised by the smell 
+So savoury of that fruit, which with desire, 
+Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, 
+Solicited her longing eye; yet first 
+Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused. 
+Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits, 
+Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired; 
+Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay 
+Gave elocution to the mute, and taught 
+The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise: 
+Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use, 
+Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree 
+Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; 
+Forbids us then to taste! but his forbidding 
+Commends thee more, while it infers the good 
+By thee communicated, and our want: 
+For good unknown sure is not had; or, had 
+And yet unknown, is as not had at all. 
+In plain then, what forbids he but to know, 
+Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? 
+Such prohibitions bind not.  But, if death 
+Bind us with after-bands, what profits then 
+Our inward freedom?  In the day we eat 
+Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die! 
+How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives, 
+And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, 
+Irrational till then.  For us alone 
+Was death invented? or to us denied 
+This intellectual food, for beasts reserved? 
+For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first 
+Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy 
+The good befallen him, author unsuspect, 
+Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile. 
+What fear I then? rather, what know to fear 
+Under this ignorance of good and evil, 
+Of God or death, of law or penalty? 
+Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine, 
+Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste, 
+Of virtue to make wise:  What hinders then 
+To reach, and feed at once both body and mind? 
+So saying, her rash hand in evil hour 
+Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat! 
+Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat, 
+Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe, 
+That all was lost.  Back to the thicket slunk 
+The guilty Serpent; and well might;for Eve, 
+Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else 
+Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed, 
+In fruit she never tasted, whether true 
+Or fancied so, through expectation high 
+Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought. 
+Greedily she ingorged without restraint, 
+And knew not eating death:  Satiate at length, 
+And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon, 
+Thus to herself she pleasingly began. 
+O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees 
+In Paradise! of operation blest 
+To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed. 
+And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end 
+Created; but henceforth my early care, 
+Not without song, each morning, and due praise, 
+Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease 
+Of thy full branches offered free to all; 
+Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature 
+In knowledge, as the Gods, who all things know; 
+Though others envy what they cannot give: 
+For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here 
+Thus grown.  Experience, next, to thee I owe, 
+Best guide; not following thee, I had remained 
+In ignorance; thou openest wisdom's way, 
+And givest access, though secret she retire. 
+And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high, 
+High, and remote to see from thence distinct 
+Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps 
+May have diverted from continual watch 
+Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies 
+About him.  But to Adam in what sort 
+Shall I appear? shall I to him make known 
+As yet my change, and give him to partake 
+Full happiness with me, or rather not, 
+But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power 
+Without copartner? so to add what wants 
+In female sex, the more to draw his love, 
+And render me more equal; and perhaps, 
+A thing not undesirable, sometime 
+Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free 
+This may be well:  But what if God have seen, 
+And death ensue? then I shall be no more! 
+And Adam, wedded to another Eve, 
+Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; 
+A death to think!  Confirmed then I resolve, 
+Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: 
+So dear I love him, that with him all deaths 
+I could endure, without him live no life. 
+So saying, from the tree her step she turned; 
+But first low reverence done, as to the Power 
+That dwelt within, whose presence had infused 
+Into the plant sciential sap, derived 
+From nectar, drink of Gods.  Adam the while, 
+Waiting desirous her return, had wove 
+Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn 
+Her tresses, and her rural labours crown; 
+As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen. 
+Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new 
+Solace in her return, so long delayed: 
+Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill, 
+Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt; 
+And forth to meet her went, the way she took 
+That morn when first they parted: by the tree 
+Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met, 
+Scarce from the tree returning; in her hand 
+A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled, 
+New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused. 
+To him she hasted; in her face excuse 
+Came prologue, and apology too prompt; 
+Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed. 
+Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay? 
+Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived 
+Thy presence; agony of love till now 
+Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more 
+Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought, 
+The pain of absence from thy sight.  But strange 
+Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear: 
+This tree is not, as we are told, a tree 
+Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown 
+Opening the way, but of divine effect 
+To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste; 
+And hath been tasted such:  The serpent wise, 
+Or not restrained as we, or not obeying, 
+Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become, 
+Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth 
+Endued with human voice and human sense, 
+Reasoning to admiration; and with me 
+Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I 
+Have also tasted, and have also found 
+The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes, 
+Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart, 
+And growing up to Godhead; which for thee 
+Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. 
+For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss; 
+Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon. 
+Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot 
+May join us, equal joy, as equal love; 
+Lest, thou not tasting, different degree 
+Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce 
+Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit. 
+Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told; 
+But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed. 
+On the other side Adam, soon as he heard 
+The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed, 
+Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill 
+Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed; 
+From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve 
+Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed: 
+Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length 
+First to himself he inward silence broke. 
+O fairest of Creation, last and best 
+Of all God's works, Creature in whom excelled 
+Whatever can to sight or thought be formed, 
+Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! 
+How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost, 
+Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote! 
+Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress 
+The strict forbiddance, how to violate 
+The sacred fruit forbidden!  Some cursed fraud 
+Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown, 
+And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee 
+Certain my resolution is to die: 
+How can I live without thee! how forego 
+Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined, 
+To live again in these wild woods forlorn! 
+Should God create another Eve, and I 
+Another rib afford, yet loss of thee 
+Would never from my heart: no, no!I feel 
+The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh, 
+Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state 
+Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. 
+So having said, as one from sad dismay 
+Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed 
+Submitting to what seemed remediless, 
+Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned. 
+Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve, 
+And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared, 
+Had it been only coveting to eye 
+That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence, 
+Much more to taste it under ban to touch. 
+But past who can recall, or done undo? 
+Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so 
+Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact 
+Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit, 
+Profaned first by the serpent, by him first 
+Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste; 
+Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives; 
+Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man, 
+Higher degree of life; inducement strong 
+To us, as likely tasting to attain 
+Proportional ascent; which cannot be 
+But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods. 
+Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, 
+Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy 
+Us his prime creatures, dignified so high, 
+Set over all his works; which in our fall, 
+For us created, needs with us must fail, 
+Dependant made; so God shall uncreate, 
+Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose; 
+Not well conceived of God, who, though his power 
+Creation could repeat, yet would be loth 
+Us to abolish, lest the Adversary 
+Triumph, and say; "Fickle their state whom God 
+"Most favours; who can please him long? Me first 
+"He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?" 
+Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe. 
+However I with thee have fixed my lot, 
+Certain to undergo like doom:  If death 
+Consort with thee, death is to me as life; 
+So forcible within my heart I feel 
+The bond of Nature draw me to my own; 
+My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; 
+Our state cannot be severed; we are one, 
+One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself. 
+So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied. 
+O glorious trial of exceeding love, 
+Illustrious evidence, example high! 
+Engaging me to emulate; but, short 
+Of thy perfection, how shall I attain, 
+Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung, 
+And gladly of our union hear thee speak, 
+One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof 
+This day affords, declaring thee resolved, 
+Rather than death, or aught than death more dread, 
+Shall separate us, linked in love so dear, 
+To undergo with me one guilt, one crime, 
+If any be, of tasting this fair fruit; 
+Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds, 
+Direct, or by occasion, hath presented 
+This happy trial of thy love, which else 
+So eminently never had been known? 
+Were it I thought death menaced would ensue 
+This my attempt, I would sustain alone 
+The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die 
+Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact 
+Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured 
+Remarkably so late of thy so true, 
+So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel 
+Far otherwise the event; not death, but life 
+Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys, 
+Taste so divine, that what of sweet before 
+Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. 
+On my experience, Adam, freely taste, 
+And fear of death deliver to the winds. 
+So saying, she embraced him, and for joy 
+Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love 
+Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur 
+Divine displeasure for her sake, or death. 
+In recompence for such compliance bad 
+Such recompence best merits from the bough 
+She gave him of that fair enticing fruit 
+With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat, 
+Against his better knowledge; not deceived, 
+But fondly overcome with female charm. 
+Earth trembled from her entrails, as again 
+In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan; 
+Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops 
+Wept at completing of the mortal sin 
+Original: while Adam took no thought, 
+Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate 
+Her former trespass feared, the more to sooth 
+Him with her loved society; that now, 
+As with new wine intoxicated both, 
+They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel 
+Divinity within them breeding wings, 
+Wherewith to scorn the earth:  But that false fruit 
+Far other operation first displayed, 
+Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve 
+Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him 
+As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn: 
+Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. 
+Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, 
+And elegant, of sapience no small part; 
+Since to each meaning savour we apply, 
+And palate call judicious; I the praise 
+Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed. 
+Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained 
+From this delightful fruit, nor known till now 
+True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be 
+In things to us forbidden, it might be wished, 
+For this one tree had been forbidden ten. 
+But come, so well refreshed, now let us play, 
+As meet is, after such delicious fare; 
+For never did thy beauty, since the day 
+I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned 
+With all perfections, so inflame my sense 
+With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now 
+Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree! 
+So said he, and forbore not glance or toy 
+Of amorous intent; well understood 
+Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire. 
+Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank, 
+Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered, 
+He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch, 
+Pansies, and violets, and asphodel, 
+And hyacinth;  Earth's freshest softest lap. 
+There they their fill of love and love's disport 
+Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal, 
+The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep 
+Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play, 
+Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit, 
+That with exhilarating vapour bland 
+About their spirits had played, and inmost powers 
+Made err, was now exhaled; and grosser sleep, 
+Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams 
+Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose 
+As from unrest; and, each the other viewing, 
+Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds 
+How darkened; innocence, that as a veil 
+Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone; 
+Just confidence, and native righteousness, 
+And honour, from about them, naked left 
+To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe 
+Uncovered more.  So rose the Danite strong, 
+Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap 
+Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked 
+Shorn of his strength.  They destitute and bare 
+Of all their virtue:  Silent, and in face 
+Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute: 
+Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed, 
+At length gave utterance to these words constrained. 
+O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear 
+To that false worm, of whomsoever taught 
+To counterfeit Man's voice; true in our fall, 
+False in our promised rising; since our eyes 
+Opened we find indeed, and find we know 
+Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got; 
+Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know; 
+Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void, 
+Of innocence, of faith, of purity, 
+Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained, 
+And in our faces evident the signs 
+Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; 
+Even shame, the last of evils; of the first 
+Be sure then.--How shall I behold the face 
+Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy 
+And rapture so oft beheld?  Those heavenly shapes 
+Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze 
+Insufferably bright.  O! might I here 
+In solitude live savage; in some glade 
+Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable 
+To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad 
+And brown as evening:  Cover me, ye Pines! 
+Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs 
+Hide me, where I may never see them more!-- 
+But let us now, as in bad plight, devise 
+What best may for the present serve to hide 
+The parts of each from other, that seem most 
+To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen; 
+Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed, 
+And girded on our loins, may cover round 
+Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame, 
+There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. 
+So counselled he, and both together went 
+Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose 
+The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned, 
+But such as at this day, to Indians known, 
+In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms 
+Branching so broad and long, that in the ground 
+The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow 
+About the mother tree, a pillared shade 
+High over-arched, and echoing walks between: 
+There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat, 
+Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds 
+At loop-holes cut through thickest shade:  Those leaves 
+They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe; 
+And, with what skill they had, together sewed, 
+To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide 
+Their guilt and dreaded shame!  O, how unlike 
+To that first naked glory!  Such of late 
+Columbus found the American, so girt 
+With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild 
+Among the trees on isles and woody shores. 
+Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part 
+Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind, 
+They sat them down to weep; nor only tears 
+Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within 
+Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate, 
+Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore 
+Their inward state of mind, calm region once 
+And full of peace, now tost and turbulent: 
+For Understanding ruled not, and the Will 
+Heard not her lore; both in subjection now 
+To sensual Appetite, who from beneath 
+Usurping over sovran Reason claimed 
+Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast, 
+Adam, estranged in look and altered style, 
+Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed. 
+Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid 
+With me, as I besought thee, when that strange 
+Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn, 
+I know not whence possessed thee; we had then 
+Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled 
+Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable! 
+Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve 
+The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek 
+Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail. 
+To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve. 
+What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe! 
+Imputest thou that to my default, or will 
+Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows 
+But might as ill have happened thou being by, 
+Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst thou been there, 
+Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned 
+Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; 
+No ground of enmity between us known, 
+Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm. 
+Was I to have never parted from thy side? 
+As good have grown there still a lifeless rib. 
+Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head, 
+Command me absolutely not to go, 
+Going into such danger, as thou saidst? 
+Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay; 
+Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. 
+Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent, 
+Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me. 
+To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied. 
+Is this the love, is this the recompence 
+Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed 
+Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I; 
+Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss, 
+Yet willingly chose rather death with thee? 
+And am I now upbraided as the cause 
+Of thy transgressing?  Not enough severe, 
+It seems, in thy restraint:  What could I more 
+I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold 
+The danger, and the lurking enemy 
+That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force; 
+And force upon free will hath here no place. 
+But confidence then bore thee on; secure 
+Either to meet no danger, or to find 
+Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps 
+I also erred, in overmuch admiring 
+What seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought 
+No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue 
+The errour now, which is become my crime, 
+And thou the accuser.  Thus it shall befall 
+Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting, 
+Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook; 
+And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue, 
+She first his weak indulgence will accuse. 
+Thus they in mutual accusation spent 
+The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning; 
+And of their vain contest appeared no end.

+ 
+ 
+Mean while the heinous and despiteful act 
+Of Satan, done in Paradise; and how 
+He, in the serpent, had perverted Eve, 
+Her husband she, to taste the fatal fruit, 
+Was known in Heaven; for what can 'scape the eye 
+Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart 
+Omniscient? who, in all things wise and just, 
+Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind 
+Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed, 
+Complete to have discovered and repulsed 
+Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend. 
+For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered, 
+The high injunction, not to taste that fruit, 
+Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, 
+(Incurred what could they less?) the penalty; 
+And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall. 
+Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste 
+The angelick guards ascended, mute, and sad, 
+For Man; for of his state by this they knew, 
+Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen 
+Entrance unseen.  Soon as the unwelcome news 
+From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased 
+All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare 
+That time celestial visages, yet, mixed 
+With pity, violated not their bliss. 
+About the new-arrived, in multitudes 
+The ethereal people ran, to hear and know 
+How all befel:  They towards the throne supreme, 
+Accountable, made haste, to make appear, 
+With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance 
+And easily approved; when the Most High 
+Eternal Father, from his secret cloud, 
+Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice. 
+Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned 
+From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed, 
+Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth, 
+Which your sincerest care could not prevent; 
+Foretold so lately what would come to pass, 
+When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell. 
+I told ye then he should prevail, and speed 
+On his bad errand; Man should be seduced, 
+And flattered out of all, believing lies 
+Against his Maker; no decree of mine 
+Concurring to necessitate his fall, 
+Or touch with lightest moment of impulse 
+His free will, to her own inclining left 
+In even scale.  But fallen he is; and now 
+What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass 
+On his transgression,--death denounced that day? 
+Which he presumes already vain and void, 
+Because not yet inflicted, as he feared, 
+By some immediate stroke; but soon shall find 
+Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end. 
+Justice shall not return as bounty scorned. 
+But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee, 
+Vicegerent Son?  To thee I have transferred 
+All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell. 
+Easy it may be seen that I intend 
+Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee 
+Man's friend, his Mediator, his designed 
+Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary, 
+And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen. 
+So spake the Father; and, unfolding bright 
+Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son 
+Blazed forth unclouded Deity: He full 
+Resplendent all his Father manifest 
+Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild. 
+Father Eternal, thine is to decree; 
+Mine, both in Heaven and Earth, to do thy will 
+Supreme; that thou in me, thy Son beloved, 
+Mayest ever rest well pleased.  I go to judge 
+On earth these thy transgressours; but thou knowest, 
+Whoever judged, the worst on me must light, 
+When time shall be; for so I undertook 
+Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain 
+Of right, that I may mitigate their doom 
+On me derived; yet I shall temper so 
+Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most 
+Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. 
+Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none 
+Are to behold the judgement, but the judged, 
+Those two; the third best absent is condemned, 
+Convict by flight, and rebel to all law: 
+Conviction to the serpent none belongs. 
+Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose 
+Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers, 
+Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant, 
+Accompanied to Heaven-gate; from whence 
+Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay. 
+Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods 
+Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged. 
+Now was the sun in western cadence low 
+From noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour, 
+To fan the earth now waked, and usher in 
+The evening cool; when he, from wrath more cool, 
+Came the mild Judge, and Intercessour both, 
+To sentence Man:  The voice of God they heard 
+Now walking in the garden, by soft winds 
+Brought to their ears, while day declined; they heard, 
+And from his presence hid themselves among 
+The thickest trees, both man and wife; till God, 
+Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud. 
+Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet 
+My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here, 
+Not pleased, thus entertained with solitude, 
+Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought: 
+Or come I less conspicuous, or what change 
+Absents thee, or what chance detains?--Come forth! 
+He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first 
+To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed; 
+Love was not in their looks, either to God, 
+Or to each other; but apparent guilt, 
+And shame, and perturbation, and despair, 
+Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile. 
+Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief. 
+I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice 
+Afraid, being naked, hid myself.  To whom 
+The gracious Judge without revile replied. 
+My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared, 
+But still rejoiced; how is it now become 
+So dreadful to thee?  That thou art naked, who 
+Hath told thee?  Hast thou eaten of the tree, 
+Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? 
+To whom thus Adam sore beset replied. 
+O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand 
+Before my Judge; either to undergo 
+Myself the total crime, or to accuse 
+My other self, the partner of my life; 
+Whose failing, while her faith to me remains, 
+I should conceal, and not expose to blame 
+By my complaint: but strict necessity 
+Subdues me, and calamitous constraint; 
+Lest on my head both sin and punishment, 
+However insupportable, be all 
+Devolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou 
+Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.-- 
+This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help, 
+And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good, 
+So fit, so acceptable, so divine, 
+That from her hand I could suspect no ill, 
+And what she did, whatever in itself, 
+Her doing seemed to justify the deed; 
+She gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 
+To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied. 
+Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey 
+Before his voice? or was she made thy guide, 
+Superiour, or but equal, that to her 
+Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place 
+Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, 
+And for thee, whose perfection far excelled 
+Hers in all real dignity?  Adorned 
+She was indeed, and lovely, to attract 
+Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts 
+Were such, as under government well seemed; 
+Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part 
+And person, hadst thou known thyself aright. 
+So having said, he thus to Eve in few. 
+Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done? 
+To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed, 
+Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge 
+Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied. 
+The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat. 
+Which when the Lord God heard, without delay 
+To judgement he proceeded on the accused 
+Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer 
+The guilt on him, who made him instrument 
+Of mischief, and polluted from the end 
+Of his creation; justly then accursed, 
+As vitiated in nature:  More to know 
+Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew) 
+Nor altered his offence; yet God at last 
+To Satan first in sin his doom applied, 
+Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best: 
+And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. 
+Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed 
+Above all cattle, each beast of the field; 
+Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go, 
+And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life. 
+Between thee and the woman I will put 
+Enmity, and between thine and her seed; 
+Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. 
+So spake this oracle, then verified 
+When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve, 
+Saw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven, 
+Prince of the air; then, rising from his grave 
+Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed 
+In open show; and, with ascension bright, 
+Captivity led captive through the air, 
+The realm itself of Satan, long usurped; 
+Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; 
+Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise; 
+And to the Woman thus his sentence turned. 
+Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply 
+By thy conception; children thou shalt bring 
+In sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will 
+Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule. 
+On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced. 
+Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, 
+And eaten of the tree, concerning which 
+I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof: 
+Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow 
+Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life; 
+Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth 
+Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 
+In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, 
+Till thou return unto the ground; for thou 
+Out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth, 
+For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return. 
+So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent; 
+And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day, 
+Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood 
+Before him naked to the air, that now 
+Must suffer change, disdained not to begin 
+Thenceforth the form of servant to assume; 
+As when he washed his servants feet; so now, 
+As father of his family, he clad 
+Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, 
+Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid; 
+And thought not much to clothe his enemies; 
+Nor he their outward only with the skins 
+Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more. 
+Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness, 
+Arraying, covered from his Father's sight. 
+To him with swift ascent he up returned, 
+Into his blissful bosom reassumed 
+In glory, as of old; to him appeased 
+All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man 
+Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. 
+Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth, 
+Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death, 
+In counterview within the gates, that now 
+Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame 
+Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through, 
+Sin opening; who thus now to Death began. 
+O Son, why sit we here each other viewing 
+Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives 
+In other worlds, and happier seat provides 
+For us, his offspring dear?  It cannot be 
+But that success attends him; if mishap, 
+Ere this he had returned, with fury driven 
+By his avengers; since no place like this 
+Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. 
+Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, 
+Wings growing, and dominion given me large 
+Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on, 
+Or sympathy, or some connatural force, 
+Powerful at greatest distance to unite, 
+With secret amity, things of like kind, 
+By secretest conveyance.  Thou, my shade 
+Inseparable, must with me along; 
+For Death from Sin no power can separate. 
+But, lest the difficulty of passing back 
+Stay his return perhaps over this gulf 
+Impassable, impervious; let us try 
+Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine 
+Not unagreeable, to found a path 
+Over this main from Hell to that new world, 
+Where Satan now prevails; a monument 
+Of merit high to all the infernal host, 
+Easing their passage hence, for intercourse, 
+Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead. 
+Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn 
+By this new-felt attraction and instinct. 
+Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon. 
+Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong, 
+Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err 
+The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw 
+Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste 
+The savour of death from all things there that live: 
+Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest 
+Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. 
+So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell 
+Of mortal change on earth.  As when a flock 
+Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote, 
+Against the day of battle, to a field, 
+Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured 
+With scent of living carcasses designed 
+For death, the following day, in bloody fight: 
+So scented the grim Feature, and upturned 
+His nostril wide into the murky air; 
+Sagacious of his quarry from so far. 
+Then both from out Hell-gates, into the waste 
+Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark, 
+Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great) 
+Hovering upon the waters, what they met 
+Solid or slimy, as in raging sea 
+Tost up and down, together crouded drove, 
+From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell; 
+As when two polar winds, blowing adverse 
+Upon the Cronian sea, together drive 
+Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way 
+Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich 
+Cathaian coast.  The aggregated soil 
+Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry, 
+As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm 
+As Delos, floating once; the rest his look 
+Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move; 
+And with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate, 
+Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach 
+They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on 
+Over the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge 
+Of length prodigious, joining to the wall 
+Immoveable of this now fenceless world, 
+Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, 
+Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell. 
+So, if great things to small may be compared, 
+Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke, 
+From Susa, his Memnonian palace high, 
+Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont 
+Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined, 
+And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves. 
+Now had they brought the work by wonderous art 
+Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock, 
+Over the vexed abyss, following the track 
+Of Satan to the self-same place where he 
+First lighted from his wing, and landed safe 
+From out of Chaos, to the outside bare 
+Of this round world:  With pins of adamant 
+And chains they made all fast, too fast they made 
+And durable!  And now in little space 
+The confines met of empyrean Heaven, 
+And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell 
+With long reach interposed; three several ways 
+In sight, to each of these three places led. 
+And now their way to Earth they had descried, 
+To Paradise first tending; when, behold! 
+Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright, 
+Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering 
+His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose: 
+Disguised he came; but those his children dear 
+Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise. 
+He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk 
+Into the wood fast by; and, changing shape, 
+To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act 
+By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded 
+Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought 
+Vain covertures; but when he saw descend 
+The Son of God to judge them, terrified 
+He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun 
+The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath 
+Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned 
+By night, and listening where the hapless pair 
+Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint, 
+Thence gathered his own doom; which understood 
+Not instant, but of future time, with joy 
+And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned; 
+And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot 
+Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped 
+Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear. 
+Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight 
+Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased. 
+Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair 
+Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke. 
+O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds, 
+Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own; 
+Thou art their author, and prime architect: 
+For I no sooner in my heart divined, 
+My heart, which by a secret harmony 
+Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet, 
+That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks 
+Now also evidence, but straight I felt, 
+Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt, 
+That I must after thee, with this thy son; 
+Such fatal consequence unites us three! 
+Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds, 
+Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure 
+Detain from following thy illustrious track. 
+Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined 
+Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered 
+To fortify thus far, and overlay, 
+With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss. 
+Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won 
+What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained 
+With odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged 
+Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign, 
+There didst not; there let him still victor sway, 
+As battle hath adjudged; from this new world 
+Retiring, by his own doom alienated; 
+And henceforth monarchy with thee divide 
+Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds, 
+His quadrature, from thy orbicular world; 
+Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne. 
+Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad. 
+Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both; 
+High proof ye now have given to be the race 
+Of Satan (for I glory in the name, 
+Antagonist of Heaven's Almighty King,) 
+Amply have merited of me, of all 
+The infernal empire, that so near Heaven's door 
+Triumphal with triumphal act have met, 
+Mine, with this glorious work; and made one realm, 
+Hell and this world, one realm, one continent 
+Of easy thorough-fare.  Therefore, while I 
+Descend through darkness, on your road with ease, 
+To my associate Powers, them to acquaint 
+With these successes, and with them rejoice; 
+You two this way, among these numerous orbs, 
+All yours, right down to Paradise descend; 
+There dwell, and reign in bliss; thence on the earth 
+Dominion exercise and in the air, 
+Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared; 
+Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. 
+My substitutes I send ye, and create 
+Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might 
+Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now 
+My hold of this new kingdom all depends, 
+Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit. 
+If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell 
+No detriment need fear; go, and be strong! 
+So saying he dismissed them; they with speed 
+Their course through thickest constellations held, 
+Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan, 
+And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse 
+Then suffered.  The other way Satan went down 
+The causey to Hell-gate:  On either side 
+Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed, 
+And with rebounding surge the bars assailed, 
+That scorned his indignation:  Through the gate, 
+Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed, 
+And all about found desolate; for those, 
+Appointed to sit there, had left their charge, 
+Flown to the upper world; the rest were all 
+Far to the inland retired, about the walls 
+Of Pandemonium; city and proud seat 
+Of Lucifer, so by allusion called 
+Of that bright star to Satan paragoned; 
+There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand 
+In council sat, solicitous what chance 
+Might intercept their emperour sent; so he 
+Departing gave command, and they observed. 
+As when the Tartar from his Russian foe, 
+By Astracan, over the snowy plains, 
+Retires; or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns 
+Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond 
+The realm of Aladule, in his retreat 
+To Tauris or Casbeen:  So these, the late 
+Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell 
+Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch 
+Round their metropolis; and now expecting 
+Each hour their great adventurer, from the search 
+Of foreign worlds:  He through the midst unmarked, 
+In show plebeian Angel militant 
+Of lowest order, passed; and from the door 
+Of that Plutonian hall, invisible 
+Ascended his high throne; which, under state 
+Of richest texture spread, at the upper end 
+Was placed in regal lustre.  Down a while 
+He sat, and round about him saw unseen: 
+At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head 
+And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter; clad 
+With what permissive glory since his fall 
+Was left him, or false glitter:  All amazed 
+At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng 
+Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld, 
+Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim: 
+Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers, 
+Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy 
+Congratulant approached him; who with hand 
+Silence, and with these words attention, won. 
+Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers; 
+For in possession such, not only of right, 
+I call ye, and declare ye now; returned 
+Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth 
+Triumphant out of this infernal pit 
+Abominable, accursed, the house of woe, 
+And dungeon of our tyrant:  Now possess, 
+As Lords, a spacious world, to our native Heaven 
+Little inferiour, by my adventure hard 
+With peril great achieved.  Long were to tell 
+What I have done; what suffered;with what pain 
+Voyaged th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep 
+Of horrible confusion; over which 
+By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved, 
+To expedite your glorious march; but I 
+Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride 
+The untractable abyss, plunged in the womb 
+Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild; 
+That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed 
+My journey strange, with clamorous uproar 
+Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found 
+The new created world, which fame in Heaven 
+Long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful 
+Of absolute perfection! therein Man 
+Placed in a Paradise, by our exile 
+Made happy:  Him by fraud I have seduced 
+From his Creator; and, the more to encrease 
+Your wonder, with an apple; he, thereat 
+Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up 
+Both his beloved Man, and all his world, 
+To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, 
+Without our hazard, labour, or alarm; 
+To range in, and to dwell, and over Man 
+To rule, as over all he should have ruled. 
+True is, me also he hath judged, or rather 
+Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape 
+Man I deceived: that which to me belongs, 
+Is enmity which he will put between 
+Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel; 
+His seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: 
+A world who would not purchase with a bruise, 
+Or much more grievous pain?--Ye have the account 
+Of my performance:  What remains, ye Gods, 
+But up, and enter now into full bliss? 
+So having said, a while he stood, expecting 
+Their universal shout, and high applause, 
+To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears 
+On all sides, from innumerable tongues, 
+A dismal universal hiss, the sound 
+Of publick scorn; he wondered, but not long 
+Had leisure, wondering at himself now more, 
+His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare; 
+His arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining 
+Each other, till supplanted down he fell 
+A monstrous serpent on his belly prone, 
+Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power 
+Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned, 
+According to his doom: he would have spoke, 
+But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue 
+To forked tongue; for now were all transformed 
+Alike, to serpents all, as accessories 
+To his bold riot:  Dreadful was the din 
+Of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now 
+With complicated monsters head and tail, 
+Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, 
+Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear, 
+And Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil 
+Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle 
+Ophiusa,) but still greatest he the midst, 
+Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun 
+Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime, 
+Huge Python, and his power no less he seemed 
+Above the rest still to retain; they all 
+Him followed, issuing forth to the open field, 
+Where all yet left of that revolted rout, 
+Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array; 
+Sublime with expectation when to see 
+In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief; 
+They saw, but other sight instead! a croud 
+Of ugly serpents; horrour on them fell, 
+And horrid sympathy; for, what they saw, 
+They felt themselves, now changing; down their arms, 
+Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast; 
+And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form 
+Catched, by contagion; like in punishment, 
+As in their crime.  Thus was the applause they meant, 
+Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame 
+Cast on themselves from their own mouths.  There stood 
+A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change, 
+His will who reigns above, to aggravate 
+Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that 
+Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve 
+Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange 
+Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining 
+For one forbidden tree a multitude 
+Now risen, to work them further woe or shame; 
+Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce, 
+Though to delude them sent, could not abstain; 
+But on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees 
+Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks 
+That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked 
+The fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew 
+Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed; 
+This more delusive, not the touch, but taste 
+Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay 
+Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit 
+Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste 
+With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed, 
+Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft, 
+With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws, 
+With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell 
+Into the same illusion, not as Man 
+Whom they triumphed once lapsed.  Thus were they plagued 
+And worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss, 
+Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed; 
+Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo, 
+This annual humbling certain numbered days, 
+To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced. 
+However, some tradition they dispersed 
+Among the Heathen, of their purchase got, 
+And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called 
+Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide-- 
+Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule 
+Of high Olympus; thence by Saturn driven 
+And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. 
+Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair 
+Too soon arrived; Sin, there in power before, 
+Once actual; now in body, and to dwell 
+Habitual habitant; behind her Death, 
+Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet 
+On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began. 
+Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death! 
+What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned 
+With travel difficult, not better far 
+Than still at Hell's dark threshold to have sat watch, 
+Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved? 
+Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon. 
+To me, who with eternal famine pine, 
+Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven; 
+There best, where most with ravine I may meet; 
+Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems 
+To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps. 
+To whom the incestuous mother thus replied. 
+Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers, 
+Feed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl; 
+No homely morsels! and, whatever thing 
+The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared; 
+Till I, in Man residing, through the race, 
+His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect; 
+And season him thy last and sweetest prey. 
+This said, they both betook them several ways, 
+Both to destroy, or unimmortal make 
+All kinds, and for destruction to mature 
+Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing, 
+From his transcendent seat the Saints among, 
+To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice. 
+See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance 
+To waste and havock yonder world, which I 
+So fair and good created; and had still 
+Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man 
+Let in these wasteful furies, who impute 
+Folly to me; so doth the Prince of Hell 
+And his adherents, that with so much ease 
+I suffer them to enter and possess 
+A place so heavenly; and, conniving, seem 
+To gratify my scornful enemies, 
+That laugh, as if, transported with some fit 
+Of passion, I to them had quitted all, 
+At random yielded up to their misrule; 
+And know not that I called, and drew them thither, 
+My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth 
+Which Man's polluting sin with taint hath shed 
+On what was pure; til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst 
+With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling 
+Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son, 
+Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last, 
+Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell 
+For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws. 
+Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure 
+To sanctity, that shall receive no stain: 
+Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes. 
+He ended, and the heavenly audience loud 
+Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas, 
+Through multitude that sung:  Just are thy ways, 
+Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works; 
+Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son, 
+Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom 
+New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise, 
+Or down from Heaven descend.--Such was their song; 
+While the Creator, calling forth by name 
+His mighty Angels, gave them several charge, 
+As sorted best with present things.  The sun 
+Had first his precept so to move, so shine, 
+As might affect the earth with cold and heat 
+Scarce tolerable; and from the north to call 
+Decrepit winter; from the south to bring 
+Solstitial summer's heat.  To the blanc moon 
+Her office they prescribed; to the other five 
+Their planetary motions, and aspects, 
+In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite, 
+Of noxious efficacy, and when to join 
+In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed 
+Their influence malignant when to shower, 
+Which of them rising with the sun, or falling, 
+Should prove tempestuous:  To the winds they set 
+Their corners, when with bluster to confound 
+Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll 
+With terrour through the dark aereal hall. 
+Some say, he bid his Angels turn ascanse 
+The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more, 
+From the sun's axle; they with labour pushed 
+Oblique the centrick globe:  Some say, the sun 
+Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road 
+Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven 
+Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins, 
+Up to the Tropick Crab: thence down amain 
+By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales, 
+As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change 
+Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring 
+Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers, 
+Equal in days and nights, except to those 
+Beyond the polar circles; to them day 
+Had unbenighted shone, while the low sun, 
+To recompense his distance, in their sight 
+Had rounded still the horizon, and not known 
+Or east or west; which had forbid the snow 
+From cold Estotiland, and south as far 
+Beneath Magellan.  At that tasted fruit 
+The sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned 
+His course intended; else, how had the world 
+Inhabited, though sinless, more than now, 
+Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat? 
+These changes in the Heavens, though slow, produced 
+Like change on sea and land; sideral blast, 
+Vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot, 
+Corrupt and pestilent:  Now from the north 
+Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shore, 
+Bursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice, 
+And snow, and hail, and stormy gust and flaw, 
+Boreas, and Caecias, and Argestes loud, 
+And Thrascias, rend the woods, and seas upturn; 
+With adverse blast upturns them from the south 
+Notus, and Afer black with thunderous clouds 
+From Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce, 
+Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds, 
+Eurus and Zephyr, with their lateral noise, 
+Sirocco and Libecchio.  Thus began 
+Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first, 
+Daughter of Sin, among the irrational 
+Death introduced, through fierce antipathy: 
+Beast now with beast 'gan war, and fowl with fowl, 
+And fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving, 
+Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe 
+Of Man, but fled him; or, with countenance grim, 
+Glared on him passing.  These were from without 
+The growing miseries, which Adam saw 
+Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, 
+To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within; 
+And, in a troubled sea of passion tost, 
+Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint. 
+O miserable of happy!  Is this the end 
+Of this new glorious world, and me so late 
+The glory of that glory, who now become 
+Accursed, of blessed? hide me from the face 
+Of God, whom to behold was then my highth 
+Of happiness!--Yet well, if here would end 
+The misery; I deserved it, and would bear 
+My own deservings; but this will not serve: 
+All that I eat or drink, or shall beget, 
+Is propagated curse.  O voice, once heard 
+Delightfully, Encrease and multiply; 
+Now death to hear! for what can I encrease, 
+Or multiply, but curses on my head? 
+Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling 
+The evil on him brought by me, will curse 
+My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure, 
+For this we may thank Adam! but his thanks 
+Shall be the execration: so, besides 
+Mine own that bide upon me, all from me 
+Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound; 
+On me, as on their natural center, light 
+Heavy, though in their place.  O fleeting joys 
+Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes! 
+Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay 
+To mould me Man? did I solicit thee 
+From darkness to promote me, or here place 
+In this delicious garden?  As my will 
+Concurred not to my being, it were but right 
+And equal to reduce me to my dust; 
+Desirous to resign and render back 
+All I received; unable to perform 
+Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold 
+The good I sought not.  To the loss of that, 
+Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added 
+The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable 
+Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out 
+To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet 
+Mortality my sentence, and be earth 
+Insensible!  How glad would lay me down 
+As in my mother's lap!  There I should rest, 
+And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more 
+Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse 
+To me, and to my offspring, would torment me 
+With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt 
+Pursues me still, lest all I cannot die; 
+Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man 
+Which God inspired, cannot together perish 
+With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave, 
+Or in some other dismal place, who knows 
+But I shall die a living death?  O thought 
+Horrid, if true!  Yet why? It was but breath 
+Of life that sinned; what dies but what had life 
+And sin?  The body properly had neither, 
+All of me then shall die: let this appease 
+The doubt, since human reach no further knows. 
+For though the Lord of all be infinite, 
+Is his wrath also?  Be it, Man is not so, 
+But mortal doomed.  How can he exercise 
+Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end? 
+Can he make deathless death?  That were to make 
+Strange contradiction, which to God himself 
+Impossible is held; as argument 
+Of weakness, not of power.  Will he draw out, 
+For anger's sake, finite to infinite, 
+In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour, 
+Satisfied never?  That were to extend 
+His sentence beyond dust and Nature's law; 
+By which all causes else, according still 
+To the reception of their matter, act; 
+Not to the extent of their own sphere.  But say 
+That death be not one stroke, as I supposed, 
+Bereaving sense, but endless misery 
+From this day onward; which I feel begun 
+Both in me, and without me; and so last 
+To perpetuity;--Ay me!that fear 
+Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution 
+On my defenceless head; both Death and I 
+Am found eternal, and incorporate both; 
+Nor I on my part single; in me all 
+Posterity stands cursed:  Fair patrimony 
+That I must leave ye, Sons!  O, were I able 
+To waste it all myself, and leave ye none! 
+So disinherited, how would you bless 
+Me, now your curse!  Ah, why should all mankind, 
+For one man's fault, thus guiltless be condemned, 
+It guiltless?  But from me what can proceed, 
+But all corrupt; both mind and will depraved 
+Not to do only, but to will the same 
+With me?  How can they then acquitted stand 
+In sight of God?  Him, after all disputes, 
+Forced I absolve: all my evasions vain, 
+And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still 
+But to my own conviction: first and last 
+On me, me only, as the source and spring 
+Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; 
+So might the wrath!  Fond wish!couldst thou support 
+That burden, heavier than the earth to bear; 
+Than all the world much heavier, though divided 
+With that bad Woman?  Thus, what thou desirest, 
+And what thou fearest, alike destroys all hope 
+Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable 
+Beyond all past example and future; 
+To Satan only like both crime and doom. 
+O Conscience! into what abyss of fears 
+And horrours hast thou driven me; out of which 
+I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged! 
+Thus Adam to himself lamented loud, 
+Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell, 
+Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air 
+Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom; 
+Which to his evil conscience represented 
+All things with double terrour:  On the ground 
+Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft 
+Cursed his creation;  Death as oft accused 
+Of tardy execution, since denounced 
+The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death, 
+Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke 
+To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word, 
+Justice Divine not hasten to be just? 
+But Death comes not at call; Justice Divine 
+Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries, 
+O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers! 
+With other echo late I taught your shades 
+To answer, and resound far other song.-- 
+Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, 
+Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh, 
+Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed: 
+But her with stern regard he thus repelled. 
+Out of my sight, thou Serpent!  That name best 
+Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false 
+And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, 
+Like his, and colour serpentine, may show 
+Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee 
+Henceforth; lest that too heavenly form, pretended 
+To hellish falshood, snare them!  But for thee 
+I had persisted happy; had not thy pride 
+And wandering vanity, when least was safe, 
+Rejected my forewarning, and disdained 
+Not to be trusted; longing to be seen, 
+Though by the Devil himself; him overweening 
+To over-reach; but, with the serpent meeting, 
+Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee 
+To trust thee from my side; imagined wise, 
+Constant, mature, proof against all assaults; 
+And understood not all was but a show, 
+Rather than solid virtue; all but a rib 
+Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, 
+More to the part sinister, from me drawn; 
+Well if thrown out, as supernumerary 
+To my just number found.  O! why did God, 
+Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven 
+With Spirits masculine, create at last 
+This novelty on earth, this fair defect 
+Of nature, and not fill the world at once 
+With Men, as Angels, without feminine; 
+Or find some other way to generate 
+Mankind?  This mischief had not been befallen, 
+And more that shall befall; innumerable 
+Disturbances on earth through female snares, 
+And strait conjunction with this sex: for either 
+He never shall find out fit mate, but such 
+As some misfortune brings him, or mistake; 
+Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain 
+Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained 
+By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld 
+By parents; or his happiest choice too late 
+Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound 
+To a fell adversary, his hate or shame: 
+Which infinite calamity shall cause 
+To human life, and houshold peace confound. 
+He added not, and from her turned; but Eve, 
+Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing 
+And tresses all disordered, at his feet 
+Fell humble; and, embracing them, besought 
+His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. 
+Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven 
+What love sincere, and reverence in my heart 
+I bear thee, and unweeting have offended, 
+Unhappily deceived!  Thy suppliant 
+I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, 
+Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, 
+Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress, 
+My only strength and stay:  Forlorn of thee, 
+Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? 
+While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps, 
+Between us two let there be peace; both joining, 
+As joined in injuries, one enmity 
+Against a foe by doom express assigned us, 
+That cruel Serpent:  On me exercise not 
+Thy hatred for this misery befallen; 
+On me already lost, me than thyself 
+More miserable!  Both have sinned;but thou 
+Against God only; I against God and thee; 
+And to the place of judgement will return, 
+There with my cries importune Heaven; that all 
+The sentence, from thy head removed, may light 
+On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe; 
+Me, me only, just object of his ire! 
+She ended weeping; and her lowly plight, 
+Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault 
+Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought 
+Commiseration:  Soon his heart relented 
+Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight, 
+Now at his feet submissive in distress; 
+Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking, 
+His counsel, whom she had displeased, his aid: 
+As one disarmed, his anger all he lost, 
+And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon. 
+Unwary, and too desirous, as before, 
+So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest 
+The punishment all on thyself; alas! 
+Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain 
+His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part, 
+And my displeasure bearest so ill.  If prayers 
+Could alter high decrees, I to that place 
+Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, 
+That on my head all might be visited; 
+Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven, 
+To me committed, and by me exposed. 
+But rise;--let us no more contend, nor blame 
+Each other, blamed enough elsewhere; but strive 
+In offices of love, how we may lighten 
+Each other's burden, in our share of woe; 
+Since this day's death denounced, if aught I see, 
+Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil; 
+A long day's dying, to augment our pain; 
+And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived. 
+To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied. 
+Adam, by sad experiment I know 
+How little weight my words with thee can find, 
+Found so erroneous; thence by just event 
+Found so unfortunate:  Nevertheless, 
+Restored by thee, vile as I am, to place 
+Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain 
+Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart 
+Living or dying, from thee I will not hide 
+What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen, 
+Tending to some relief of our extremes, 
+Or end; though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, 
+As in our evils, and of easier choice. 
+If care of our descent perplex us most, 
+Which must be born to certain woe, devoured 
+By Death at last; and miserable it is 
+To be to others cause of misery, 
+Our own begotten, and of our loins to bring 
+Into this cursed world a woeful race, 
+That after wretched life must be at last 
+Food for so foul a monster; in thy power 
+It lies, yet ere conception to prevent 
+The race unblest, to being yet unbegot. 
+Childless thou art, childless remain: so Death 
+Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two 
+Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw. 
+But if thou judge it hard and difficult, 
+Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain 
+From love's due rights, nuptial embraces sweet; 
+And with desire to languish without hope, 
+Before the present object languishing 
+With like desire; which would be misery 
+And torment less than none of what we dread; 
+Then, both ourselves and seed at once to free 
+From what we fear for both, let us make short, -- 
+Let us seek Death; -- or, he not found, supply 
+With our own hands his office on ourselves: 
+Why stand we longer shivering under fears, 
+That show no end but death, and have the power, 
+Of many ways to die the shortest choosing, 
+Destruction with destruction to destroy? -- 
+She ended here, or vehement despair 
+Broke off the rest: so much of death her thoughts 
+Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale. 
+But Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed, 
+To better hopes his more attentive mind 
+Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied. 
+Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems 
+To argue in thee something more sublime 
+And excellent, than what thy mind contemns; 
+But self-destruction therefore sought, refutes 
+That excellence thought in thee; and implies, 
+Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret 
+For loss of life and pleasure overloved. 
+Or if thou covet death, as utmost end 
+Of misery, so thinking to evade 
+The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God 
+Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire, than so 
+To be forestalled; much more I fear lest death, 
+So snatched, will not exempt us from the pain 
+We are by doom to pay; rather, such acts 
+Of contumacy will provoke the Highest 
+To make death in us live:  Then let us seek 
+Some safer resolution, which methinks 
+I have in view, calling to mind with heed 
+Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise 
+The Serpent's head; piteous amends! unless 
+Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe, 
+Satan; who, in the serpent, hath contrived 
+Against us this deceit:  To crush his head 
+Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost 
+By death brought on ourselves, or childless days 
+Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe 
+Shal 'scape his punishment ordained, and we 
+Instead shall double ours upon our heads. 
+No more be mentioned then of violence 
+Against ourselves; and wilful barrenness, 
+That cuts us off from hope; and savours only 
+Rancour and pride, impatience and despite, 
+Reluctance against God and his just yoke 
+Laid on our necks.  Remember with what mild 
+And gracious temper he both heard, and judged, 
+Without wrath or reviling; we expected 
+Immediate dissolution, which we thought 
+Was meant by death that day; when lo!to thee 
+Pains only in child-bearing were foretold, 
+And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy, 
+Fruit of thy womb:  On me the curse aslope 
+Glanced on the ground; with labour I must earn 
+My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse; 
+My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold 
+Or heat should injure us, his timely care 
+Hath, unbesought, provided; and his hands 
+Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged; 
+How much more, if we pray him, will his ear 
+Be open, and his heart to pity incline, 
+And teach us further by what means to shun 
+The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow! 
+Which now the sky, with various face, begins 
+To show us in this mountain; while the winds 
+Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks 
+Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek 
+Some better shroud, some better warmth to cherish 
+Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star 
+Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams 
+Reflected may with matter sere foment; 
+Or, by collision of two bodies, grind 
+The air attrite to fire; as late the clouds 
+Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock, 
+Tine the slant lightning; whose thwart flame, driven down 
+Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine; 
+And sends a comfortable heat from far, 
+Which might supply the sun:  Such fire to use, 
+And what may else be remedy or cure 
+To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, 
+He will instruct us praying, and of grace 
+Beseeching him; so as we need not fear 
+To pass commodiously this life, sustained 
+By him with many comforts, till we end 
+In dust, our final rest and native home. 
+What better can we do, than, to the place 
+Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall 
+Before him reverent; and there confess 
+Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears 
+Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air 
+Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign 
+Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+Book XI                                                          
+ 
+ 
+Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn 
+From his displeasure; in whose look serene, 
+When angry most he seemed and most severe, 
+What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone? 
+So spake our father penitent; nor Eve 
+Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place 
+Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell 
+Before him reverent; and both confessed 
+Humbly their faults, and pardon begged; with tears 
+Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air 
+Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign 
+Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek. 
+Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood 
+Praying; for from the mercy-seat above 
+Prevenient grace descending had removed 
+The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh 
+Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed 
+Unutterable; which the Spirit of prayer 
+Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight 
+Than loudest oratory:  Yet their port 
+Not of mean suitors; nor important less 
+Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair 
+In fables old, less ancient yet than these, 
+Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore 
+The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine 
+Of Themis stood devout.  To Heaven their prayers 
+Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds 
+Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed 
+Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then clad 
+With incense, where the golden altar fumed, 
+By their great intercessour, came in sight 
+Before the Father's throne: them the glad Son 
+Presenting, thus to intercede began. 
+See$ Father, what first-fruits on earth are sprung 
+From thy implanted grace in Man; these sighs 
+And prayers, which in this golden censer mixed 
+With incense, I thy priest before thee bring; 
+Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed 
+Sown with contrition in his heart, than those 
+Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees 
+Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen 
+From innocence.  Now therefore, bend thine ear 
+To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute; 
+Unskilful with what words to pray, let me 
+Interpret for him; me, his advocate 
+And propitiation; all his works on me, 
+Good, or not good, ingraft; my merit those 
+Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay. 
+Accept me; and, in me, from these receive 
+The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live 
+Before thee reconciled, at least his days 
+Numbered, though sad; till death, his doom, (which I 
+To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,) 
+To better life shall yield him: where with me 
+All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss; 
+Made one with me, as I with thee am one. 
+To whom the Father, without cloud, serene. 
+All thy request for Man, accepted Son, 
+Obtain; all thy request was my decree: 
+But, longer in that Paradise to dwell, 
+The law I gave to Nature him forbids: 
+Those pure immortal elements, that know, 
+No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul, 
+Eject him, tainted now; and purge him off, 
+As a distemper, gross, to air as gross, 
+And mortal food; as may dispose him best 
+For dissolution wrought by sin, that first 
+Distempered all things, and of incorrupt 
+Corrupted.  I, at first, with two fair gifts 
+Created him endowed; with happiness, 
+And immortality: that fondly lost, 
+This other served but to eternize woe; 
+Till I provided death: so death becomes 
+His final remedy; and, after life, 
+Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined 
+By faith and faithful works, to second life, 
+Waked in the renovation of the just, 
+Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed. 
+But let us call to synod all the Blest, 
+Through Heaven's wide bounds: from them I will not hide 
+My judgements; how with mankind I proceed, 
+As how with peccant Angels late they saw, 
+And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed. 
+He ended, and the Son gave signal high 
+To the bright minister that watched; he blew 
+His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps 
+When God descended, and perhaps once more 
+To sound at general doom.  The angelick blast 
+Filled all the regions: from their blisful bowers 
+Of amarantine shade, fountain or spring, 
+By the waters of life, where'er they sat 
+In fellowships of joy, the sons of light 
+Hasted, resorting to the summons high; 
+And took their seats; till from his throne supreme 
+The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will. 
+O Sons, like one of us Man is become 
+To know both good and evil, since his taste 
+Of that defended fruit; but let him boast 
+His knowledge of good lost, and evil got; 
+Happier! had it sufficed him to have known 
+Good by itself, and evil not at all. 
+He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite, 
+My motions in him; longer than they move, 
+His heart I know, how variable and vain, 
+Self-left.  Lest therefore his now bolder hand 
+Reach also of the tree of life, and eat, 
+And live for ever, dream at least to live 
+For ever, to remove him I decree, 
+And send him from the garden forth to till 
+The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil. 
+Michael, this my behest have thou in charge; 
+Take to thee from among the Cherubim 
+Thy choice of flaming warriours, lest the Fiend, 
+Or in behalf of Man, or to invade 
+Vacant possession, some new trouble raise: 
+Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God 
+Without remorse drive out the sinful pair; 
+From hallowed ground the unholy; and denounce 
+To them, and to their progeny, from thence 
+Perpetual banishment.  Yet, lest they faint 
+At the sad sentence rigorously urged, 
+(For I behold them softened, and with tears 
+Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide. 
+If patiently thy bidding they obey, 
+Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal 
+To Adam what shall come in future days, 
+As I shall thee enlighten; intermix 
+My covenant in the Woman's seed renewed; 
+So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: 
+And on the east side of the garden place, 
+Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs, 
+Cherubick watch; and of a sword the flame 
+Wide-waving; all approach far off to fright, 
+And guard all passage to the tree of life: 
+Lest Paradise a receptacle prove 
+To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey; 
+With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude. 
+He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared 
+For swift descent; with him the cohort bright 
+Of watchful Cherubim: four faces each 
+Had, like a double Janus; all their shape 
+Spangled with eyes more numerous than those 
+Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse, 
+Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed 
+Of Hermes, or his opiate rod.  Mean while, 
+To re-salute the world with sacred light, 
+Leucothea waked; and with fresh dews imbalmed 
+The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve 
+Had ended now their orisons, and found 
+Strength added from above; new hope to spring 
+Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet linked; 
+Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed. 
+Eve, easily my faith admit, that all 
+The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends; 
+But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven 
+So prevalent as to concern the mind 
+Of God high-blest, or to incline his will, 
+Hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer 
+Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne 
+Even to the seat of God.  For since I sought 
+By prayer the offended Deity to appease; 
+Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart; 
+Methought I saw him placable and mild, 
+Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew 
+That I was heard with favour; peace returned 
+Home to my breast, and to my memory 
+His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe; 
+Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now 
+Assures me that the bitterness of death 
+Is past, and we shall live.  Whence hail to thee, 
+Eve rightly called, mother of all mankind, 
+Mother of all things living, since by thee 
+Man is to live; and all things live for Man. 
+To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. 
+Ill-worthy I such title should belong 
+To me transgressour; who, for thee ordained 
+A help, became thy snare; to me reproach 
+Rather belongs, distrust, and all dispraise: 
+But infinite in pardon was my Judge, 
+That I, who first brought death on all, am graced 
+The source of life; next favourable thou, 
+Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf'st, 
+Far other name deserving.  But the field 
+To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed, 
+Though after sleepless night; for see!the morn, 
+All unconcerned with our unrest, begins 
+Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth; 
+I never from thy side henceforth to stray, 
+Where'er our day's work lies, though now enjoined 
+Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, 
+What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks? 
+Here let us live, though in fallen state, content. 
+So spake, so wished much humbled Eve; but Fate 
+Subscribed not:  Nature first gave signs, impressed 
+On bird, beast, air; air suddenly eclipsed, 
+After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight 
+The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour, 
+Two birds of gayest plume before him drove; 
+Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods, 
+First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace, 
+Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind; 
+Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight. 
+Adam observed, and with his eye the chase 
+Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake. 
+O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh, 
+Which Heaven, by these mute signs in Nature, shows 
+Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn 
+Us, haply too secure, of our discharge 
+From penalty, because from death released 
+Some days: how long, and what till then our life, 
+Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust, 
+And thither must return, and be no more? 
+Why else this double object in our sight 
+Of flight pursued in the air, and o'er the ground, 
+One way the self-same hour? why in the east 
+Darkness ere day's mid-course, and morning-light 
+More orient in yon western cloud, that draws 
+O'er the blue firmament a radiant white, 
+And slow descends with something heavenly fraught? 
+He erred not; for by this the heavenly bands 
+Down from a sky of jasper lighted now 
+In Paradise, and on a hill made halt; 
+A glorious apparition, had not doubt 
+And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam's eye. 
+Not that more glorious, when the Angels met 
+Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw 
+The field pavilioned with his guardians bright; 
+Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared 
+In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire, 
+Against the Syrian king, who to surprise 
+One man, assassin-like, had levied war, 
+War unproclaimed.  The princely Hierarch 
+In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise 
+Possession of the garden; he alone, 
+To find where Adam sheltered, took his way, 
+Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve, 
+While the great visitant approached, thus spake. 
+Eve$ now expect great tidings, which perhaps 
+Of us will soon determine, or impose 
+New laws to be observed; for I descry, 
+From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill, 
+One of the heavenly host; and, by his gait, 
+None of the meanest; some great Potentate 
+Or of the Thrones above; such majesty 
+Invests him coming! yet not terrible, 
+That I should fear; nor sociably mild, 
+As Raphael, that I should much confide; 
+But solemn and sublime; whom not to offend, 
+With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. 
+He ended: and the Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, 
+Not in his shape celestial, but as man 
+Clad to meet man; over his lucid arms 
+A military vest of purple flowed, 
+Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain 
+Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old 
+In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof; 
+His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime 
+In manhood where youth ended; by his side, 
+As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword, 
+Satan's dire dread; and in his hand the spear. 
+Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state 
+Inclined not, but his coming thus declared. 
+Adam, Heaven's high behest no preface needs: 
+Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death, 
+Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, 
+Defeated of his seisure many days 
+Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent, 
+And one bad act with many deeds well done 
+Mayest cover:  Well may then thy Lord, appeased, 
+Redeem thee quite from Death's rapacious claim; 
+But longer in this Paradise to dwell 
+Permits not: to remove thee I am come, 
+And send thee from the garden forth to till 
+The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil. 
+He added not; for Adam at the news 
+Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, 
+That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen 
+Yet all had heard, with audible lament 
+Discovered soon the place of her retire. 
+O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death! 
+Must I thus leave thee$ Paradise? thus leave 
+Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades, 
+Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, 
+Quiet though sad, the respite of that day 
+That must be mortal to us both.  O flowers, 
+That never will in other climate grow, 
+My early visitation, and my last 
+ ;t even, which I bred up with tender hand 
+From the first opening bud, and gave ye names! 
+Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank 
+Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount? 
+Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned 
+With what to sight or smell was sweet! from thee 
+How shall I part, and whither wander down 
+Into a lower world; to this obscure 
+And wild? how shall we breathe in other air 
+Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits? 
+Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild. 
+Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign 
+What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart, 
+Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine: 
+Thy going is not lonely; with thee goes 
+Thy husband; whom to follow thou art bound; 
+Where he abides, think there thy native soil. 
+Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp 
+Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned, 
+To Michael thus his humble words addressed. 
+Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named 
+Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem 
+Prince above princes! gently hast thou told 
+Thy message, which might else in telling wound, 
+And in performing end us; what besides 
+Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair, 
+Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring, 
+Departure from this happy place, our sweet 
+Recess, and only consolation left 
+Familiar to our eyes! all places else 
+Inhospitable appear, and desolate; 
+Nor knowing us, nor known:  And, if by prayer 
+Incessant I could hope to change the will 
+Of Him who all things can, I would not cease 
+To weary him with my assiduous cries: 
+But prayer against his absolute decree 
+No more avails than breath against the wind, 
+Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth: 
+Therefore to his great bidding I submit. 
+This most afflicts me, that, departing hence, 
+As from his face I shall be hid, deprived 
+His blessed countenance:  Here I could frequent 
+With worship place by place where he vouchsafed 
+Presence Divine; and to my sons relate, 
+'On this mount he appeared; under this tree 
+'Stood visible; among these pines his voice 
+'I heard; here with him at this fountain talked: 
+So many grateful altars I would rear 
+Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone 
+Of lustre from the brook, in memory, 
+Or monument to ages; and theron 
+Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers: 
+In yonder nether world where shall I seek 
+His bright appearances, or foot-step trace? 
+For though I fled him angry, yet recalled 
+To life prolonged and promised race, I now 
+Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts 
+Of glory; and far off his steps adore. 
+To whom thus Michael with regard benign. 
+Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth; 
+Not this rock only; his Omnipresence fills 
+Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives, 
+Fomented by his virtual power and warmed: 
+All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule, 
+No despicable gift; surmise not then 
+His presence to these narrow bounds confined 
+Of Paradise, or Eden: this had been 
+Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread 
+All generations; and had hither come 
+From all the ends of the earth, to celebrate 
+And reverence thee, their great progenitor. 
+But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down 
+To dwell on even ground now with thy sons: 
+Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain, 
+God is, as here; and will be found alike 
+Present; and of his presence many a sign 
+Still following thee, still compassing thee round 
+With goodness and paternal love, his face 
+Express, and of his steps the track divine. 
+Which that thou mayest believe, and be confirmed 
+Ere thou from hence depart; know, I am sent 
+To show thee what shall come in future days 
+To thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad 
+Expect to hear; supernal grace contending 
+With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn 
+True patience, and to temper joy with fear 
+And pious sorrow; equally inured 
+By moderation either state to bear, 
+Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead 
+Safest thy life, and best prepared endure 
+Thy mortal passage when it comes.--Ascend 
+This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes) 
+Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest; 
+As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed. 
+To whom thus Adam gratefully replied. 
+Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path 
+Thou leadest me; and to the hand of Heaven submit, 
+However chastening; to the evil turn 
+My obvious breast; arming to overcome 
+By suffering, and earn rest from labour won, 
+If so I may attain. -- So both ascend 
+In the visions of God.  It was a hill, 
+Of Paradise the highest; from whose top 
+The hemisphere of earth, in clearest ken, 
+Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. 
+Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round, 
+Whereon, for different cause, the Tempter set 
+Our second Adam, in the wilderness; 
+To show him all Earth's kingdoms, and their glory. 
+His eye might there command wherever stood 
+City of old or modern fame, the seat 
+Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls 
+Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can, 
+And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir's throne, 
+To Paquin of Sinaean kings; and thence 
+To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul, 
+Down to the golden Chersonese; or where 
+The Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since 
+In Hispahan; or where the Russian Ksar 
+In Mosco; or the Sultan in Bizance, 
+Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken 
+The empire of Negus to his utmost port 
+Ercoco, and the less maritim kings 
+Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, 
+And Sofala, thought Ophir, to the realm 
+Of Congo, and Angola farthest south; 
+Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount 
+The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus, 
+Morocco, and Algiers, and Tremisen; 
+On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway 
+The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw 
+Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume, 
+And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat 
+Of Atabalipa; and yet unspoiled 
+Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons 
+Call El Dorado.  But to nobler sights 
+Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed, 
+Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight 
+Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue 
+The visual nerve, for he had much to see; 
+And from the well of life three drops instilled. 
+So deep the power of these ingredients pierced, 
+Even to the inmost seat of mental sight, 
+That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes, 
+Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced; 
+But him the gentle Angel by the hand 
+Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled. 
+Adam, now ope thine eyes; and first behold 
+The effects, which thy original crime hath wrought 
+In some to spring from thee; who never touched 
+The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired; 
+Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive 
+Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds. 
+His eyes he opened, and beheld a field, 
+Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves 
+New reaped; the other part sheep-walks and folds; 
+I' the midst an altar as the land-mark stood, 
+Rustick, of grassy sord; thither anon 
+A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought 
+First fruits, the green ear, and the yellow sheaf, 
+Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next, 
+More meek, came with the firstlings of his flock, 
+Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid 
+The inwards and their fat, with incense strowed, 
+On the cleft wood, and all due rights performed: 
+His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven 
+Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam; 
+The other's not, for his was not sincere; 
+Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked, 
+Smote him into the midriff with a stone 
+That beat out life; he fell;and, deadly pale, 
+Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused. 
+Much at that sight was Adam in his heart 
+Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried. 
+O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen 
+To that meek man, who well had sacrificed; 
+Is piety thus and pure devotion paid? 
+To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied. 
+These two are brethren, Adam, and to come 
+Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain, 
+For envy that his brother's offering found 
+From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact 
+Will be avenged; and the other's faith, approved, 
+Lose no reward; though here thou see him die, 
+Rolling in dust and gore.  To which our sire. 
+Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause! 
+But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way 
+I must return to native dust?  O sight 
+Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, 
+Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! 
+To whom thus Michael.  Death thou hast seen 
+In his first shape on Man; but many shapes 
+Of Death, and many are the ways that lead 
+To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense 
+More terrible at the entrance, than within. 
+Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die; 
+By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more 
+In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring 
+Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew 
+Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know 
+What misery the inabstinence of Eve 
+Shall bring on Men.  Immediately a place 
+Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark; 
+A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid 
+Numbers of all diseased; all maladies 
+Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms 
+Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds, 
+Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs, 
+Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs, 
+Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy, 
+And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy, 
+Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence, 
+Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums. 
+Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair 
+Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch; 
+And over them triumphant Death his dart 
+Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked 
+With vows, as their chief good, and final hope. 
+Sight so deform what heart of rock could long 
+Dry-eyed behold?  Adam could not, but wept, 
+Though not of woman born; compassion quelled 
+His best of man, and gave him up to tears 
+A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess; 
+And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed. 
+O miserable mankind, to what fall 
+Degraded, to what wretched state reserved! 
+Better end here unborn.  Why is life given 
+To be thus wrested from us? rather, why 
+Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew 
+What we receive, would either no accept 
+Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down; 
+Glad to be so dismissed in peace.  Can thus 
+The image of God in Man, created once 
+So goodly and erect, though faulty since, 
+To such unsightly sufferings be debased 
+Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man, 
+Retaining still divine similitude 
+In part, from such deformities be free, 
+And, for his Maker's image sake, exempt? 
+Their Maker's image, answered Michael, then 
+Forsook them, when themselves they vilified 
+To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took 
+His image whom they served, a brutish vice, 
+Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. 
+Therefore so abject is their punishment, 
+Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own; 
+Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced; 
+While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules 
+To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they 
+God's image did not reverence in themselves. 
+I yield it just, said Adam, and submit. 
+But is there yet no other way, besides 
+These painful passages, how we may come 
+To death, and mix with our connatural dust? 
+There is, said Michael, if thou well observe 
+The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught, 
+In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence 
+Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, 
+Till many years over thy head return: 
+So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop 
+Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease 
+Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature: 
+This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive 
+Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty; which will change 
+To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then, 
+Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego, 
+To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth, 
+Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign 
+A melancholy damp of cold and dry 
+To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume 
+The balm of life.  To whom our ancestor. 
+Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong 
+Life much; bent rather, how I may be quit, 
+Fairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge; 
+Which I must keep till my appointed day 
+Of rendering up, and patiently attend 
+My dissolution.  Michael replied. 
+Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest 
+Live well; how long, or short, permit to Heaven: 
+And now prepare thee for another sight. 
+He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon 
+Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds 
+Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound 
+Of instruments, that made melodious chime, 
+Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved 
+Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch, 
+Instinct through all proportions, low and high, 
+Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue. 
+In other part stood one who, at the forge 
+Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass 
+Had melted, (whether found where casual fire 
+Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale, 
+Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot 
+To some cave's mouth; or whether washed by stream 
+From underground;) the liquid ore he drained 
+Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed 
+First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought 
+Fusil or graven in metal.  After these, 
+But on the hither side, a different sort 
+From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat, 
+Down to the plain descended; by their guise 
+Just men they seemed, and all their study bent 
+To worship God aright, and know his works 
+Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve 
+Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain 
+Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold! 
+A bevy of fair women, richly gay 
+In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung 
+Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on: 
+The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes 
+Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net 
+Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose; 
+And now of love they treat, till the evening-star, 
+Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat 
+They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke 
+Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked: 
+With feast and musick all the tents resound. 
+Such happy interview, and fair event 
+Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers, 
+And charming symphonies, attached the heart 
+Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight, 
+The bent of nature; which he thus expressed. 
+True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest; 
+Much better seems this vision, and more hope 
+Of peaceful days portends, than those two past; 
+Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse; 
+Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends. 
+To whom thus Michael.  Judge not what is best 
+By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet; 
+Created, as thou art, to nobler end 
+Holy and pure, conformity divine. 
+Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents 
+Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race 
+Who slew his brother; studious they appear 
+Of arts that polish life, inventers rare; 
+Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit 
+Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none. 
+Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget; 
+For that fair female troop thou sawest, that seemed 
+Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, 
+Yet empty of all good wherein consists 
+Woman's domestick honour and chief praise; 
+Bred only and completed to the taste 
+Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, 
+To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye: 
+To these that sober race of men, whose lives 
+Religious titled them the sons of God, 
+Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame 
+Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles 
+Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy, 
+Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which 
+The world erelong a world of tears must weep. 
+To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft. 
+O pity and shame, that they, who to live well 
+Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread 
+Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! 
+But still I see the tenour of Man's woe 
+Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. 
+From Man's effeminate slackness it begins, 
+Said the Angel, who should better hold his place 
+By wisdom, and superiour gifts received. 
+But now prepare thee for another scene. 
+He looked, and saw wide territory spread 
+Before him, towns, and rural works between; 
+Cities of men with lofty gates and towers, 
+Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war, 
+Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise; 
+Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed, 
+Single or in array of battle ranged 
+Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood; 
+One way a band select from forage drives 
+A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine, 
+From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock, 
+Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain, 
+Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly, 
+But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray; 
+With cruel tournament the squadrons join; 
+Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies 
+With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field, 
+Deserted:  Others to a city strong 
+Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine, 
+Assaulting; others from the wall defend 
+With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire; 
+On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds. 
+In other part the sceptered heralds call 
+To council, in the city-gates; anon 
+Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed, 
+Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon, 
+In factious opposition; till at last, 
+Of middle age one rising, eminent 
+In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong, 
+Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace, 
+And judgement from above: him old and young 
+Exploded, and had seized with violent hands, 
+Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence 
+Unseen amid the throng: so violence 
+Proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law, 
+Through all the plain, and refuge none was found. 
+Adam was all in tears, and to his guide 
+Lamenting turned full sad; O!what are these, 
+Death's ministers, not men? who thus deal death 
+Inhumanly to men, and multiply 
+Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew 
+His brother: for of whom such massacre 
+Make they, but of their brethren; men of men 
+But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven 
+Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost? 
+To whom thus Michael.  These are the product 
+Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest; 
+Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves 
+Abhor to join; and, by imprudence mixed, 
+Produce prodigious births of body or mind. 
+Such were these giants, men of high renown; 
+For in those days might only shall be admired, 
+And valour and heroick virtue called; 
+To overcome in battle, and subdue 
+Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite 
+Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch 
+Of human glory; and for glory done 
+Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours 
+Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods; 
+Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men. 
+Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth; 
+And what most merits fame, in silence hid. 
+But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst 
+The only righteous in a world preverse, 
+And therefore hated, therefore so beset 
+With foes, for daring single to be just, 
+And utter odious truth, that God would come 
+To judge them with his Saints; him the Most High 
+Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds 
+Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God 
+High in salvation and the climes of bliss, 
+Exempt from death; to show thee what reward 
+Awaits the good; the rest what punishment; 
+Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. 
+He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed; 
+The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar; 
+All now was turned to jollity and game, 
+To luxury and riot, feast and dance; 
+Marrying or prostituting, as befel, 
+Rape or adultery, where passing fair 
+Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils. 
+At length a reverend sire among them came, 
+And of their doings great dislike declared, 
+And testified against their ways; he oft 
+Frequented their assemblies, whereso met, 
+Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached 
+Conversion and repentance, as to souls 
+In prison, under judgements imminent: 
+But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased 
+Contending, and removed his tents far off; 
+Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall, 
+Began to build a vessel of huge bulk; 
+Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth; 
+Smeared round with pitch; and in the side a door 
+Contrived; and of provisions laid in large, 
+For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange! 
+Of every beast, and bird, and insect small, 
+Came sevens, and pairs; and entered in as taught 
+Their order: last the sire and his three sons, 
+With their four wives; and God made fast the door. 
+Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings 
+Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove 
+From under Heaven; the hills to their supply 
+Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist, 
+Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky 
+Like a dark cieling stood; down rushed the rain 
+Impetuous; and continued, till the earth 
+No more was seen: the floating vessel swum 
+Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow 
+Rode tilting o'er the waves; all dwellings else 
+Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp 
+Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea, 
+Sea without shore; and in their palaces, 
+Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped 
+And stabled; of mankind, so numerous late, 
+All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked. 
+How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold 
+The end of all thy offspring, end so sad, 
+Depopulation!  Thee another flood, 
+Of tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned, 
+And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared 
+By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last, 
+Though comfortless; as when a father mourns 
+His children, all in view destroyed at once; 
+And scarce to the Angel utter'dst thus thy plaint. 
+O visions ill foreseen!  Better had I 
+Lived ignorant of future! so had borne 
+My part of evil only, each day's lot 
+Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed 
+The burden of many ages, on me light 
+At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth 
+Abortive, to torment me ere their being, 
+With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek 
+Henceforth to be foretold, what shall befall 
+Him or his children; evil he may be sure, 
+Which neither his foreknowing can prevent; 
+And he the future evil shall no less 
+In apprehension than in substance feel, 
+Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, 
+Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped 
+Famine and anguish will at last consume, 
+Wandering that watery desart:  I had hope, 
+When violence was ceased, and war on earth, 
+All would have then gone well; peace would have crowned 
+With length of happy days the race of Man; 
+But I was far deceived; for now I see 
+Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste. 
+How comes it thus? unfold, celestial Guide, 
+And whether here the race of Man will end. 
+To whom thus Michael.  Those, whom last thou sawest 
+In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they 
+First seen in acts of prowess eminent 
+And great exploits, but of true virtue void; 
+Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast 
+Subduing nations, and achieved thereby 
+Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey; 
+Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, 
+Surfeit, and lust; till wantonness and pride 
+Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace. 
+The conquered also, and enslaved by war, 
+Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose 
+And fear of God; from whom their piety feigned 
+In sharp contest of battle found no aid 
+Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal, 
+Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, 
+Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords 
+Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear 
+More than enough, that temperance may be tried: 
+So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved; 
+Justice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot; 
+One man except, the only son of light 
+In a dark age, against example good, 
+Against allurement, custom, and a world 
+Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn, 
+The grand-child, with twelve sons encreased, departs 
+From Canaan, to a land hereafter called 
+Egypt, divided by the river Nile; 
+See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths 
+Into the sea:  To sojourn in that land 
+He comes, invited by a younger son 
+In time of dearth; a son, whose worthy deeds 
+Raise him to be the second in that realm 
+Of Pharaoh:  There he dies, and leaves his race 
+Growing into a nation, and now grown 
+Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks 
+To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests 
+Or violence, he of their wicked ways 
+Shall them admonish; and before them set 
+The paths of righteousness, how much more safe 
+And full of peace; denouncing wrath to come 
+On their impenitence; and shall return 
+Of them derided, but of God observed 
+The one just man alive; by his command 
+Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst, 
+To save himself, and houshold, from amidst 
+A world devote to universal wrack. 
+No sooner he, with them of man and beast 
+Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged, 
+And sheltered round; but all the cataracts 
+Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour 
+Rain, day and night; all fountains of the deep, 
+Broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp 
+Beyond all bounds; till inundation rise 
+Above the highest hills:  Then shall this mount 
+Of Paradise by might of waves be moved 
+Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood, 
+With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift, 
+Down the great river to the opening gulf, 
+And there take root an island salt and bare, 
+The haunt of seals, and orcs, and sea-mews' clang: 
+To teach thee that God attributes to place 
+No sanctity, if none be thither brought 
+By men who there frequent, or therein dwell. 
+And now, what further shall ensue, behold. 
+He looked, and saw the ark hull on the flood, 
+Which now abated; for the clouds were fled, 
+Driven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry, 
+Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed; 
+And the clear sun on his wide watery glass 
+Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew, 
+As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink 
+From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole 
+With soft foot towards the deep; who now had stopt 
+His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut. 
+The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground, 
+Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed. 
+And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear; 
+With clamour thence the rapid currents drive, 
+Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide. 
+Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies, 
+And after him, the surer messenger, 
+A dove sent forth once and again to spy 
+Green tree or ground, whereon his foot may light: 
+The second time returning, in his bill 
+An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign: 
+Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark 
+The ancient sire descends, with all his train; 
+Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, 
+Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds 
+A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow 
+Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, 
+Betokening peace from God, and covenant new. 
+Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad, 
+Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth. 
+O thou, who future things canst represent 
+As present, heavenly Instructer!  I revive 
+At this last sight; assured that Man shall live, 
+With all the creatures, and their seed preserve. 
+Far less I now lament for one whole world 
+Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice 
+For one man found so perfect, and so just, 
+That God vouchsafes to raise another world 
+From him, and all his anger to forget. 
+But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven 
+Distended, as the brow of God appeased? 
+Or serve they, as a flowery verge, to bind 
+The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud, 
+Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth? 
+To whom the Arch-Angel.  Dextrously thou aimest; 
+So willingly doth God remit his ire, 
+Though late repenting him of Man depraved; 
+Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw 
+The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh 
+Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed, 
+Such grace shall one just man find in his sight, 
+That he relents, not to blot out mankind; 
+And makes a covenant never to destroy 
+The earth again by flood; nor let the sea 
+Surpass his bounds; nor rain to drown the world, 
+With man therein or beast; but, when he brings 
+Over the earth a cloud, will therein set 
+His triple-coloured bow, whereon to look, 
+And call to mind his covenant: Day and night, 
+Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost, 
+Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new, 
+Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. 
+ 
+

+ 
+ 
+As one who in his journey bates at noon, 
+Though bent on speed; so here the Arch-Angel paused 
+Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored, 
+If Adam aught perhaps might interpose; 
+Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes. 
+Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and end; 
+And Man, as from a second stock, proceed. 
+Much thou hast yet to see; but I perceive 
+Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine 
+Must needs impair and weary human sense: 
+Henceforth what is to come I will relate; 
+Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. 
+This second source of Men, while yet but few, 
+And while the dread of judgement past remains 
+Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity, 
+With some regard to what is just and right 
+Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace; 
+Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop, 
+Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock, 
+Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid, 
+With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast, 
+Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell 
+Long time in peace, by families and tribes, 
+Under paternal rule: till one shall rise 
+Of proud ambitious heart; who, not content 
+With fair equality, fraternal state, 
+Will arrogate dominion undeserved 
+Over his brethren, and quite dispossess 
+Concord and law of nature from the earth; 
+Hunting (and men not beasts shall be his game) 
+With war, and hostile snare, such as refuse 
+Subjection to his empire tyrannous: 
+A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled 
+Before the Lord; as in despite of Heaven, 
+Or from Heaven, claiming second sovranty; 
+And from rebellion shall derive his name, 
+Though of rebellion others he accuse. 
+He with a crew, whom like ambition joins 
+With him or under him to tyrannize, 
+Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find 
+The plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge 
+Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell: 
+Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build 
+A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven; 
+And get themselves a name; lest, far dispersed 
+In foreign lands, their memory be lost; 
+Regardless whether good or evil fame. 
+But God, who oft descends to visit men 
+Unseen, and through their habitations walks 
+To mark their doings, them beholding soon, 
+Comes down to see their city, ere the tower 
+Obstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets 
+Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase 
+Quite out their native language; and, instead, 
+To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: 
+Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud, 
+Among the builders; each to other calls 
+Not understood; till hoarse, and all in rage, 
+As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven, 
+And looking down, to see the hubbub strange, 
+And hear the din:  Thus was the building left 
+Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named. 
+Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased. 
+O execrable son! so to aspire 
+Above his brethren; to himself assuming 
+Authority usurped, from God not given: 
+He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl, 
+Dominion absolute; that right we hold 
+By his donation; but man over men 
+He made not lord; such title to himself 
+Reserving, human left from human free. 
+But this usurper his encroachment proud 
+Stays not on Man; to God his tower intends 
+Siege and defiance:  Wretched man!what food 
+Will he convey up thither, to sustain 
+Himself and his rash army; where thin air 
+Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross, 
+And famish him of breath, if not of bread? 
+To whom thus Michael.  Justly thou abhorrest 
+That son, who on the quiet state of men 
+Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue 
+Rational liberty; yet know withal, 
+Since thy original lapse, true liberty 
+Is lost, which always with right reason dwells 
+Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being: 
+Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed, 
+Immediately inordinate desires, 
+And upstart passions, catch the government 
+From reason; and to servitude reduce 
+Man, till then free.  Therefore, since he permits 
+Within himself unworthy powers to reign 
+Over free reason, God, in judgement just, 
+Subjects him from without to violent lords; 
+Who oft as undeservedly enthrall 
+His outward freedom:  Tyranny must be; 
+Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse. 
+Yet sometimes nations will decline so low 
+From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong, 
+But justice, and some fatal curse annexed, 
+Deprives them of their outward liberty; 
+Their inward lost:  Witness the irreverent son 
+Of him who built the ark; who, for the shame 
+Done to his father, heard this heavy curse, 
+Servant of servants, on his vicious race. 
+Thus will this latter, as the former world, 
+Still tend from bad to worse; till God at last, 
+Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw 
+His presence from among them, and avert 
+His holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth 
+To leave them to their own polluted ways; 
+And one peculiar nation to select 
+From all the rest, of whom to be invoked, 
+A nation from one faithful man to spring: 
+Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, 
+Bred up in idol-worship:  O, that men 
+(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, 
+While yet the patriarch lived, who 'scaped the flood, 
+As to forsake the living God, and fall 
+To worship their own work in wood and stone 
+For Gods!  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes 
+To call by vision, from his father's house, 
+His kindred, and false Gods, into a land 
+Which he will show him; and from him will raise 
+A mighty nation; and upon him shower 
+His benediction so, that in his seed 
+All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys; 
+Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes: 
+I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith 
+He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil, 
+Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford 
+To Haran; after him a cumbrous train 
+Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude; 
+Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth 
+With God, who called him, in a land unknown. 
+Canaan he now attains; I see his tents 
+Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain 
+Of Moreh; there by promise he receives 
+Gift to his progeny of all that land, 
+From Hameth northward to the Desart south; 
+(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed;) 
+From Hermon east to the great western Sea; 
+Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold 
+In prospect, as I point them; on the shore 
+Mount Carmel; here, the double-founted stream, 
+Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons 
+Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills. 
+This ponder, that all nations of the earth 
+Shall in his seed be blessed:  By that seed 
+Is meant thy great Deliverer, who shall bruise 
+The Serpent's head; whereof to thee anon 
+Plainlier shall be revealed.  This patriarch blest, 
+Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call, 
+A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves; 
+Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown: 
+The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs 
+From Canaan to a land hereafter called 
+Egypt, divided by the river Nile 
+See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths 
+Into the sea. To sojourn in that land 
+He comes, invited by a younger son 
+In time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds 
+Raise him to be the second in that realm 
+Of Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race 
+Growing into a nation, and now grown 
+Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks 
+To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests 
+Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves 
+Inhospitably, and kills their infant males: 
+Till by two brethren (these two brethren call 
+Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim 
+His people from enthralment, they return, 
+With glory and spoil, back to their promised land. 
+But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies 
+To know their God, or message to regard, 
+Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire; 
+To blood unshed the rivers must be turned; 
+Frogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill 
+With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land; 
+His cattle must of rot and murren die; 
+Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss, 
+And all his people; thunder mixed with hail, 
+Hail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky, 
+And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls; 
+What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain, 
+A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down 
+Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green; 
+Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, 
+Palpable darkness, and blot out three days; 
+Last, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born 
+Of Egypt must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds 
+The river-dragon tamed at length submits 
+To let his sojourners depart, and oft 
+Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice 
+More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage 
+Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea 
+Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass, 
+As on dry land, between two crystal walls; 
+Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand 
+Divided, till his rescued gain their shore: 
+Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend, 
+Though present in his Angel; who shall go 
+Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire; 
+By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire; 
+To guide them in their journey, and remove 
+Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues: 
+All night he will pursue; but his approach 
+Darkness defends between till morning watch; 
+Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud, 
+God looking forth will trouble all his host, 
+And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command 
+Moses once more his potent rod extends 
+Over the sea; the sea his rod obeys; 
+On their embattled ranks the waves return, 
+And overwhelm their war:  The race elect 
+Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance 
+Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way; 
+Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed, 
+War terrify them inexpert, and fear 
+Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather 
+Inglorious life with servitude; for life 
+To noble and ignoble is more sweet 
+Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on. 
+This also shall they gain by their delay 
+In the wide wilderness; there they shall found 
+Their government, and their great senate choose 
+Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained: 
+God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top 
+Shall tremble, he descending, will himself 
+In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets' sound, 
+Ordain them laws; part, such as appertain 
+To civil justice; part, religious rites 
+Of sacrifice; informing them, by types 
+And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise 
+The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve 
+Mankind's deliverance.  But the voice of God 
+To mortal ear is dreadful:  They beseech 
+That Moses might report to them his will, 
+And terrour cease; he grants what they besought, 
+Instructed that to God is no access 
+Without Mediator, whose high office now 
+Moses in figure bears; to introduce 
+One greater, of whose day he shall foretel, 
+And all the Prophets in their age the times 
+Of great Messiah shall sing.  Thus, laws and rites 
+Established, such delight hath God in Men 
+Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes 
+Among them to set up his tabernacle; 
+The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell: 
+By his prescript a sanctuary is framed 
+Of cedar, overlaid with gold; therein 
+An ark, and in the ark his testimony, 
+The records of his covenant; over these 
+A mercy-seat of gold, between the wings 
+Of two bright Cherubim; before him burn 
+Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing 
+The heavenly fires; over the tent a cloud 
+Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night; 
+Save when they journey, and at length they come, 
+Conducted by his Angel, to the land 
+Promised to Abraham and his seed:--The rest 
+Were long to tell; how many battles fought 
+How many kings destroyed; and kingdoms won; 
+Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still 
+A day entire, and night's due course adjourn, 
+Man's voice commanding, 'Sun, in Gibeon stand, 
+'And thou moon in the vale of Aialon, 
+'Till Israel overcome! so call the third 
+From Abraham, son of Isaac; and from him 
+His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win. 
+Here Adam interposed.  O sent from Heaven, 
+Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things 
+Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern 
+Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find 
+Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased; 
+Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become 
+Of me and all mankind:  But now I see 
+His day, in whom all nations shall be blest; 
+Favour unmerited by me, who sought 
+Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means. 
+This yet I apprehend not, why to those 
+Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth 
+So many and so various laws are given; 
+So many laws argue so many sins 
+Among them; how can God with such reside? 
+To whom thus Michael.  Doubt not but that sin 
+Will reign among them, as of thee begot; 
+And therefore was law given them, to evince 
+Their natural pravity, by stirring up 
+Sin against law to fight: that when they see 
+Law can discover sin, but not remove, 
+Save by those shadowy expiations weak, 
+The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude 
+Some blood more precious must be paid for Man; 
+Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness 
+To them by faith imputed, they may find 
+Justification towards God, and peace 
+Of conscience; which the law by ceremonies 
+Cannot appease; nor Man the mortal part 
+Perform; and, not performing, cannot live. 
+So law appears imperfect; and but given 
+With purpose to resign them, in full time, 
+Up to a better covenant; disciplined 
+From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit; 
+From imposition of strict laws to free 
+Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear 
+To filial; works of law to works of faith. 
+And therefore shall not Moses, though of God 
+Highly beloved, being but the minister 
+Of law, his people into Canaan lead; 
+But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call, 
+His name and office bearing, who shall quell 
+The adversary-Serpent, and bring back 
+Through the world's wilderness long-wandered Man 
+Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. 
+Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed, 
+Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins 
+National interrupt their publick peace, 
+Provoking God to raise them enemies; 
+From whom as oft he saves them penitent 
+By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom 
+The second, both for piety renowned 
+And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive 
+Irrevocable, that his regal throne 
+For ever shall endure; the like shall sing 
+All Prophecy, that of the royal stock 
+Of David (so I name this king) shall rise 
+A Son, the Woman's seed to thee foretold, 
+Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust 
+All nations; and to kings foretold, of kings 
+The last; for of his reign shall be no end. 
+But first, a long succession must ensue; 
+And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed, 
+The clouded ark of God, till then in tents 
+Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine. 
+Such follow him, as shall be registered 
+Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll; 
+Whose foul idolatries, and other faults 
+Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense 
+God, as to leave them, and expose their land, 
+Their city, his temple, and his holy ark, 
+With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey 
+To that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest 
+Left in confusion; Babylon thence called. 
+There in captivity he lets them dwell 
+The space of seventy years; then brings them back, 
+Remembering mercy, and his covenant sworn 
+To David, stablished as the days of Heaven. 
+Returned from Babylon by leave of kings 
+Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God 
+They first re-edify; and for a while 
+In mean estate live moderate; till, grown 
+In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; 
+But first among the priests dissention springs, 
+Men who attend the altar, and should most 
+Endeavour peace: their strife pollution brings 
+Upon the temple itself: at last they seise 
+The scepter, and regard not David's sons; 
+Then lose it to a stranger, that the true 
+Anointed King Messiah might be born 
+Barred of his right; yet at his birth a star, 
+Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come; 
+And guides the eastern sages, who inquire 
+His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold: 
+His place of birth a solemn Angel tells 
+To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night; 
+They gladly thither haste, and by a quire 
+Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung. 
+A virgin is his mother, but his sire 
+The power of the Most High:  He shall ascend 
+The throne hereditary, and bound his reign 
+With Earth's wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens. 
+He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy 
+Surcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears, 
+Without the vent of words; which these he breathed. 
+O prophet of glad tidings, finisher 
+Of utmost hope! now clear I understand 
+What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain; 
+Why our great Expectation should be called 
+The seed of Woman:  Virgin Mother, hail, 
+High in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins 
+Thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son 
+Of God Most High: so God with Man unites! 
+Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise 
+Expect with mortal pain:  Say where and when 
+Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel. 
+To whom thus Michael.  Dream not of their fight, 
+As of a duel, or the local wounds 
+Of head or heel:  Not therefore joins the Son 
+Manhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil 
+Thy enemy; nor so is overcome 
+Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise, 
+Disabled, not to give thee thy death's wound: 
+Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, 
+Not by destroying Satan, but his works 
+In thee, and in thy seed:  Nor can this be, 
+But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, 
+Obedience to the law of God, imposed 
+On penalty of death, and suffering death; 
+The penalty to thy transgression due, 
+And due to theirs which out of thine will grow: 
+So only can high Justice rest appaid. 
+The law of God exact he shall fulfil 
+Both by obedience and by love, though love 
+Alone fulfil the law; thy punishment 
+He shall endure, by coming in the flesh 
+To a reproachful life, and cursed death; 
+Proclaiming life to all who shall believe 
+In his redemption; and that his obedience, 
+Imputed, becomes theirs by faith; his merits 
+To save them, not their own, though legal, works. 
+For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed, 
+Seised on by force, judged, and to death condemned 
+A shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross 
+By his own nation; slain for bringing life: 
+But to the cross he nails thy enemies, 
+The law that is against thee, and the sins 
+Of all mankind, with him there crucified, 
+Never to hurt them more who rightly trust 
+In this his satisfaction; so he dies, 
+But soon revives; Death over him no power 
+Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light 
+Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise 
+Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, 
+Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, 
+His death for Man, as many as offered life 
+Neglect not, and the benefit embrace 
+By faith not void of works:  This God-like act 
+Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died, 
+In sin for ever lost from life; this act 
+Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength, 
+Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms; 
+And fix far deeper in his head their stings 
+Than temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel, 
+Or theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep, 
+A gentle wafting to immortal life. 
+Nor after resurrection shall he stay 
+Longer on earth, than certain times to appear 
+To his disciples, men who in his life 
+Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge 
+To teach all nations what of him they learned 
+And his salvation; them who shall believe 
+Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign 
+Of washing them from guilt of sin to life 
+Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall, 
+For death, like that which the Redeemer died. 
+All nations they shall teach; for, from that day, 
+Not only to the sons of Abraham's loins 
+Salvation shall be preached, but to the sons 
+Of Abraham's faith wherever through the world; 
+So in his seed all nations shall be blest. 
+Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend 
+With victory, triumphing through the air 
+Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise 
+The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains 
+Through all his realm, and there confounded leave; 
+Then enter into glory, and resume 
+His seat at God's right hand, exalted high 
+Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come, 
+When this world's dissolution shall be ripe, 
+With glory and power to judge both quick and dead; 
+To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward 
+His faithful, and receive them into bliss, 
+Whether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth 
+Shall all be Paradise, far happier place 
+Than this of Eden, and far happier days. 
+So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused, 
+As at the world's great period; and our sire, 
+Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied. 
+O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense! 
+That all this good of evil shall produce, 
+And evil turn to good; more wonderful 
+Than that which by creation first brought forth 
+Light out of darkness!  Full of doubt I stand, 
+Whether I should repent me now of sin 
+By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice 
+Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring; 
+To God more glory, more good-will to Men 
+From God, and over wrath grace shall abound. 
+But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven 
+Must re-ascend, what will betide the few 
+His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd, 
+The enemies of truth?  Who then shall guide 
+His people, who defend?  Will they not deal 
+Worse with his followers than with him they dealt? 
+Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven 
+He to his own a Comforter will send, 
+The promise of the Father, who shall dwell 
+His Spirit within them; and the law of faith, 
+Working through love, upon their hearts shall write, 
+To guide them in all truth; and also arm 
+With spiritual armour, able to resist 
+Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts; 
+What man can do against them, not afraid, 
+Though to the death; against such cruelties 
+With inward consolations recompensed, 
+And oft supported so as shall amaze 
+Their proudest persecutors:  For the Spirit, 
+Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends 
+To evangelize the nations, then on all 
+Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue 
+To speak all tongues, and do all miracles, 
+As did their Lord before them.  Thus they win 
+Great numbers of each nation to receive 
+With joy the tidings brought from Heaven:  At length 
+Their ministry performed, and race well run, 
+Their doctrine and their story written left, 
+They die; but in their room, as they forewarn, 
+Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves, 
+Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven 
+To their own vile advantages shall turn 
+Of lucre and ambition; and the truth 
+With superstitions and traditions taint, 
+Left only in those written records pure, 
+Though not but by the Spirit understood. 
+Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, 
+Places, and titles, and with these to join 
+Secular power; though feigning still to act 
+By spiritual, to themselves appropriating 
+The Spirit of God, promised alike and given 
+To all believers; and, from that pretence, 
+Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force 
+On every conscience; laws which none shall find 
+Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within 
+Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then 
+But force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind 
+His consort Liberty? what, but unbuild 
+His living temples, built by faith to stand, 
+Their own faith, not another's? for, on earth, 
+Who against faith and conscience can be heard 
+Infallible? yet many will presume: 
+Whence heavy persecution shall arise 
+On all, who in the worship persevere 
+Of spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part, 
+Will deem in outward rites and specious forms 
+Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire 
+Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith 
+Rarely be found:  So shall the world go on, 
+To good malignant, to bad men benign; 
+Under her own weight groaning; till the day 
+Appear of respiration to the just, 
+And vengeance to the wicked, at return 
+Of him so lately promised to thy aid, 
+The Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold, 
+Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord; 
+Last, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed 
+In glory of the Father, to dissolve 
+Satan with his perverted world; then raise 
+From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined, 
+New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date, 
+Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love; 
+To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss. 
+He ended; and thus Adam last replied. 
+How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, 
+Measured this transient world, the race of time, 
+Till time stand fixed!  Beyond is all abyss, 
+Eternity, whose end no eye can reach. 
+Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart; 
+Greatly in peace of thought; and have my fill 
+Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain; 
+Beyond which was my folly to aspire. 
+Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best, 
+And love with fear the only God; to walk 
+As in his presence; ever to observe 
+His providence; and on him sole depend, 
+Merciful over all his works, with good 
+Still overcoming evil, and by small 
+Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak 
+Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise 
+By simply meek: that suffering for truth's sake 
+Is fortitude to highest victory, 
+And, to the faithful, death the gate of life; 
+Taught this by his example, whom I now 
+Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. 
+To whom thus also the Angel last replied. 
+This having learned, thou hast attained the sum 
+Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars 
+Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers, 
+All secrets of the deep, all Nature's works, 
+Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea, 
+And all the riches of this world enjoyedst, 
+And all the rule, one empire; only add 
+Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith, 
+Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love, 
+By name to come called charity, the soul 
+Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth 
+To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess 
+A Paradise within thee, happier far.-- 
+Let us descend now therefore from this top 
+Of speculation; for the hour precise 
+Exacts our parting hence; and see!the guards, 
+By me encamped on yonder hill, expect 
+Their motion; at whose front a flaming sword, 
+In signal of remove, waves fiercely round: 
+We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; 
+Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed 
+Portending good, and all her spirits composed 
+To meek submission: thou, at season fit, 
+Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard; 
+Chiefly what may concern her faith to know, 
+The great deliverance by her seed to come 
+(For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind: 
+That ye may live, which will be many days, 
+Both in one faith unanimous, though sad, 
+With cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered 
+With meditation on the happy end. 
+He ended, and they both descend the hill; 
+Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve 
+Lay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked; 
+And thus with words not sad she him received. 
+Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know; 
+For God is also in sleep; and dreams advise, 
+Which he hath sent propitious, some great good 
+Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress 
+Wearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on; 
+In me is no delay; with thee to go, 
+Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, 
+Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me 
+Art all things under $Heaven, all places thou, 
+Who for my wilful crime art banished hence. 
+This further consolation yet secure 
+I carry hence; though all by me is lost, 
+Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed, 
+By me the Promised Seed shall all restore. 
+So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard 
+Well pleased, but answered not:  For now, too nigh 
+The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill 
+To their fixed station, all in bright array 
+The Cherubim descended; on the ground 
+Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist 
+Risen from a river o'er the marish glides, 
+And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel 
+Homeward returning.  High in front advanced, 
+The brandished sword of God before them blazed, 
+Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat, 
+And vapour as the Libyan air adust, 
+Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat 
+In either hand the hastening Angel caught 
+Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate 
+Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast 
+To the subjected plain; then disappeared. 
+They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld 
+Of Paradise, so late their happy seat, 
+Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate 
+With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms: 
+Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon; 
+The world was all before them, where to choose 
+Their place of rest, and Providence their guide: 
+They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, 
+Through Eden took their solitary way.
